	abstract = {On the basis of earlier reported data on the in vitro kinematics of passive knee-joint motions of four knee specimens, the length changes of ligament fiber bundles were determined by using the points of insertion on the tibia and femur. The kinematic data and the insertions of the ligaments were obtained by using Roentgenstereo-photogrammetry. Different fiber bundles of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments and the medial and lateral collateral ligaments were identified. On the basis of an assumption for the maximal strain of each ligament fiber bundle during the experiments, the minimal recruitment length and the probability of recruitment were defined and determined. The motions covered the range from extension to 95 degrees flexion and the loading conditions included internal or external moments of 3 Nm and anterior or posterior forces of 30 N. The ligament length and recruitment patterns were found to be consistent for some ligament bundles and less consistent for other ligament bundles. The most posterior bundle of each ligament was recruited in extension and the lower flexion angles, whereas the anterior bundle was recruited for the higher flexion angles. External rotation generally recruited the collateral ligaments, while internal rotation recruited the cruciate ligaments. However, the anterior bundle of the posterior cruciate ligament was recruited with external rotation at the higher flexion angles. At the lower flexion angles, the anterior cruciate and the lateral collateral ligaments were recruited with an anterior force. The recruitment of the posterior cruciate ligament with a posterior force showed that neither its most anterior nor its most posterior bundle was recruited at the lower flexion angles. Hence, the posterior restraint must have been provided by the intermediate fiber bundles, which were not considered in the experiment. At the higher flexion angles, the anterior bundles of the anterior cruciate ligament and the posterior cruciate ligament were found to be recruited with anterior and posterior forces, respectively. The minimal recruitment length and the recruitment probability of ligament fiber bundles are useful parameters for the evaluation of ligament length changes in those experiments where no other method can be used to determine the zero strain lengths, ligament strains and tensions.},

	abstract = {Small variability associated with identifying and locating anatomical landmarks on the knee has the potential to affect the joint coordinate systems and reported kinematic descriptions. The objectives of this study were to develop an approach to quantify the effect of landmark location variability on both tibiofemoral and patellofemoral kinematics and to identify the critical landmarks and associated degrees of freedom that most affected the kinematic measures. The commonly used three-cylindric open-chain kinematic description utilized measured rigid body kinematics from a cadaveric specimen during simulated gait. A probabilistic analysis was performed with 11 anatomical landmarks to predict the variability in each kinematic. The model predicted the absolute kinematic bounds and offset kinematic bounds, emphasizing profile shape, for each kinematic over the gait cycle, as well as the range of motion. Standard deviations of up to 2 mm were assumed for the anatomical landmark locations and resulted in significant variability in clinically relevant absolute kinematic parameters of up to 6.5 degrees and 4.4 mm for tibiofemoral and 7.6 degrees and 6.5 mm for patellofemoral kinematics. The location of the femoral epicondylar prominences had the greatest effect on both the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral kinematic descriptions. A quantitative understanding of the potential changes in kinematic description caused by anatomical landmark variability is important not only to the accuracy of kinematic gait studies and the evaluation of total knee arthroplasty implant performance, but also may impact component placement decision-making in computer-assisted surgery.

These patterns are essential for understanding thoroughly the contribution of these soft tissues to joint function and of value in surgical treatments for a more conscious assessment of the knee status. Measurements from 10 normal cadaver knees are here reported using an accurate surgical navigation system and consistent anatomical references, over a large flexion arc, and according to current recommended conventions. The contours of relevant sub-bundles were digitised over the corresponding origins and insertions on the bones. Representative fibres were calculated as the straight line segments joining the centroids of these attachment areas. The most isometric fibre was also taken as that whose attachment points were at the minimum change in length over the flexion arc. Changes in length and orientation of these fibres were reported versus the flexion angle. A good general repeatability of intra- and inter-specimens was found. Isometric fibres were found in the locations reported in the literature. During knee flexion, ligament sub-bundles slacken in the anterior cruciate ligament, and in the medial and lateral collateral ligaments, whereas they tighten in the posterior cruciate ligament. In each cruciate ligament the two compounding sub-bundles have different extents for the change in fibre length, and also bend differently from each other on both tibial planes. In the collateral ligaments and patellar tendon all fibres bend posteriorly. Patellar tendon underwent complex changes in length and orientation, on both the tibial sagittal and frontal planes. For the first time thorough and consistent patterns of geometrical changes are provided for the main knee ligaments and tendons after careful fibre mapping.},

The tibial attachment is relatively compact, with the ALB anterior to the PLB.

	abstract = {Purpose: To define the positions of the attachments of the anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL) bundles of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Methods: The shape and positions of the femoral and tibial attachments of the 2 bundles relative to bony landmarks were measured in 7 fresh-frozen, unpaired cadaveric knees by 6 independent observers. Metallic marker beads were then inserted into the defined anatomic points, and plain radiographs of the specimens were taken. We used the line described by Amis and Jakob on the tibia and the grid prepared by Bernard et al. for the femur to define AM and PL bundle attachment positions. Results: In the cadaveric specimens, referencing the position of the AM bundle tibial attachment from the retro-eminence ridge (RER) resulted in the least interobserver error. On tibial radiographs, the distance between the posterior tibial cortex and the perpendicular projection of the center of the AM bundle attachment onto Amis and Jakob’s line was 35.6 ± 5.1 mm. The ratio of this distance to the length of Amis and Jakob’s line (from the anterior cortex) was 36\% ± 3.8\% (and 52\% ± 3.4\% for the center of the PL bundle). On the femur, the center of the AM bundle was situated at 26.4\% ± 2.6\%, and the center of the PL bundle at 32.3\% ± 3.9\%, along the length of Blumensaat’s line. Conclusions: The RER provides an easily identifiable and accurate reference point that can be used clinically. On a lateral radiograph, the positions of the tibial attachments can be referenced to Amis and Jakob’s line. This method, different from Blumensaat’s line, is independent of knee flexion. Clinical Relevance: This study details anatomically and radiologically the positions of the attachments of the AM and PL bundles of the ACL. This could assist with accurate tunnel placement in reconstruction surgery and provide reference data for postoperative radiographic evaluation.},

	abstract = {Surgical technique is one factor that has been identified as critical to success of total knee arthroplasty. Researchers have shown that computer simulations can aid in determining how decisions in the operating room generally affect post-operative outcomes. However, to use simulations to make clinically relevant predictions about knee forces and motions for a specific total knee patient, patient-specific models are needed. This study introduces a methodology for estimating knee soft-tissue properties of an individual total knee patient. A custom surgical navigation system and stability device were used to measure the force–displacement relationship of the knee. Soft-tissue properties were estimated using a parameter optimization that matched simulated tibiofemoral kinematics with experimental tibiofemoral kinematics. Simulations using optimized ligament properties had an average root mean square error of 3.5° across all tests while simulations using generic ligament properties taken from literature had an average root mean square error of 8.4°. Specimens showed large variability among ligament properties regardless of similarities in prosthetic component alignment and measured knee laxity. These results demonstrate the importance of soft-tissue properties in determining knee stability, and suggest that to make clinically relevant predictions of post-operative knee motions and forces using computer simulations, patient-specific soft-tissue properties are needed. © 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

For this reason, it is desirable to develop instruments to quantitatively assess the soft-tissue balance since excessive imbalance can accelerate prosthesis wear and lead to early surgical revision. The instrumented distractor proposed in this study can assist surgeons on performing ligament balance by measuring the distraction gap and applied load. Also the device allows the determination of the ligament stiffness which can contribute a better understanding of the intrinsic mechanical behavior of the knee joint. Instrumentation of the device involved the use of hall-sensors for measuring the distractor displacement and strain gauges to transduce the force. The sensors were calibrated and tested to demonstrate their suitability for surgical use. Results show the distraction gap can be measured reliably with 0.1 mm accuracy and the distractive loads could be assessed with an accuracy in the range of 4 N. These characteristics are consistent with those have been proposed, in this work, for a device that could assist on performing ligament balance while permitting surgeons evaluation based on his experience.

	abstract = {Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is a common and potentially catastrophic knee joint injury, afflicting a large number of males and particularly females annually. Apart from the obvious acute injury events, it also presents with significant long-term morbidities, in which osteoarthritis (OA) is a frequent and debilitative outcome. With these facts in mind, a vast amount of research has been undertaken over the past five decades geared toward characterizing the structural and mechanical behaviors of the native ACL tissue under various external load applications. While these efforts have afforded important insights, both in terms of understanding treating and rehabilitating ACL injuries; injury rates, their well-established sex-based disparity, and long-term sequelae have endured. In reviewing the expanse of literature conducted to date in this area, this paper identifies important knowledge gaps that contribute directly to this long-standing clinical dilemma. In particular, the following limitations remain. First, minimal data exist that accurately describe native ACL mechanics under the extreme loading rates synonymous with actual injury. Second, current ACL mechanical data are typically derived from isolated and oversimplified strain estimates that fail to adequately capture the true 3D mechanical response of this anatomically complex structure. Third, graft tissues commonly chosen to reconstruct the ruptured ACL are mechanically suboptimal, being overdesigned for stiffness compared to the native tissue. The net result is an increased risk of rerupture and a modified and potentially hazardous habitual joint contact profile. These major limitations appear to warrant explicit research attention moving forward in order to successfully maintain/restore optimal knee joint function and long-term life quality in a large number of otherwise healthy individuals.},

Our in vivo data on the ovine ligament loads during gait, however, indicate that a wide range of forces is possible in the ligament for any specified inter-insertional distance. To understand the complex relationship between the bone orientations and ligament load better, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed. The six degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) in vivo kinematics of femur relative to tibia (joint kinematics) was used as input, and the magnitude of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) load was used as output/target. While the trained network was able to predict peak ligament loads with remarkable accuracy (R-square=0.98), an explicit relationship between joint kinematics and ACL load could not be determined. To examine the experimental and ANN observations further, a finite element (FE) model of the ACL was created. The geometry of the FE model was reconstructed from magnetic resonance images (MRI) of an ACL, and an isotropic, hyperelastic, nearly incompressible constitutive model was implemented for the ACL. The FE simulation results also indicate that a range of loads is possible in the ACL for a given inter-insertional distance, in concordance with the experimental/ANN observations. This study provides new insights for models of the knee joint; a simple force–length relationship for the ligament is not exact, nor is a single point to single point direction. More detailed microstructure-function data is required.},

These values were significantly increased at extension and flexion as the distraction force increased.

Thus, larger joint distraction forces led to larger varus ligament balance and joint center gap, because of the difference in soft tissue stiffness between lateral and medial compartments.

	abstract = {During knee-joint motions, the fiber bundles of the knee ligaments are nonuniformly loaded in a recruitment pattern, which depends on successive relative orientations of the insertion sites. These fiber bundles vary with respect to length, orientation and mechanical properties. As a result, the stiffness characteristics of the ligaments as a whole are variable during knee-joint motion. The purpose of the present study is to characterize this variable mechanical behavior. It is hypothesized that for this purpose it is essential to consider the ligaments mechanically as multi-bundle structures in which the variability in fiber bundle characteristics is accounted for, rather than as one-dimensional structures. To verify this hypothesis, bone-ligament-bone preparations of the ligaments were subjected to series of unidirectional subfailure tensile tests in which the relative insertion orientations were varied. For each individual test specimen, this series of tensile tests was simulated with a mathematical ligament model. Geometrically, this model consists of multiple line elements, of which the insertions and orientations are anatomically based. In a mathematical optimization process, the unknown stiffness and recruitment parameters of the line elements are identified by fitting the variable stiffness characteristics of the model to those of the test series. Thus, lumped parameters are obtained which describe the mechanical behavior of the ligament as a function of the relative insertion orientation. This method of identification was applied to all four knee ligaments. In all cases, a satisfactory fit between experimental results and computer simulation was obtained, although the residual errors were lower for the cruciate ligaments (1.0–2.4\%) than for the collateral ligaments (3.7–8.1\%). It was found that models with three or less line elements were very sensitive to geometrical parameters, whereas models with more than 7 line elements suffered from mathematical redundancy. Between 4 and 7 line elements little difference was found. It is concluded that the present ligament models can realistically simulate the variable tensile behavior of human knee ligaments. Hereby the hypothesis is verified that it is essential to consider the ligaments of the knee as multi-bundle structures in order to characterize fully their mechanical behavior.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of ligament fibre recruitment at the human ankle joint complex is a fundamental prerequisite for analysing mobility and stability. Previous experimental and modelling studies have shown that ankle motion must be guided by fibres within the calcaneofibular and tibiocalcaneal ligaments, which remain approximately isometric during passive flexion. The purpose of this study was to identify these fibres.

Three below-knee amputated specimens were analysed during passive flexion with combined radiostereometry for bone pose estimation and 3D digitisation for ligament attachment area identification. A procedure based on singular value decomposition enabled matching bone pose with digitised data and therefore reconstructing position in space of ligament attachment areas in each joint position. Eleven ordered fibres, connecting corresponding points on origin and insertion curves, were modelled for each of the following ligaments: posterior talofibular, calcaneofibular, anterior talofibular, posterior tibiotalar, tibiocalcaneal, and anterior tibiotalar.

The measured changes in length for the ligament fibres revealed patterns of tightening and slackening. The most anterior fibre of the calcaneofibular and the medio-anterior fibre of the tibiocalcaneal ligament exhibited the most isometric behaviour, as well as the most posterior fibre of the anterior talofibular ligament. Fibres within the calcaneofibular ligament remain parallel in the transverse plane, while those within the tibiocalcaneal ligament become almost parallel in joint neutral position. For both these ligaments, fibres maintain their relative inclination in the sagittal plane throughout the passive flexion range.

The observed significant change in both shape and orientation of the ankle ligaments suggest that this knowledge is fundamental for future mechanical analysis of their response to external forces.},

	abstract = {Ligaments and tendons undergo volume loss when stretched along the primary fiber axis, which is evident by the large, strain-dependent Poisson׳s ratios measured during quasi-static tensile tests. Continuum constitutive models that have been used to describe ligament material behavior generally assume incompressibility, which does not reflect the volumetric material behavior seen experimentally. We developed a strain energy equation that describes large, strain dependent Poisson׳s ratios and nonlinear, transversely isotropic behavior using a novel method to numerically enforce the desired volumetric behavior. The Cauchy stress and spatial elasticity tensors for this strain energy equation were derived and implemented in the FEBio finite element software (www.febio.org). As part of this objective, we derived the Cauchy stress and spatial elasticity tensors for a compressible transversely isotropic material, which to our knowledge have not appeared previously in the literature. Elastic simulations demonstrated that the model predicted the nonlinear, upwardly concave uniaxial stress–strain behavior while also predicting a strain-dependent Poisson׳s ratio. Biphasic simulations of stress relaxation predicted a large outward fluid flux and substantial relaxation of the peak stress. Thus, the results of this study demonstrate that the viscoelastic behavior of ligaments and tendons can be predicted by modeling fluid movement when combined with a large Poisson׳s ratio. Further, the constitutive framework provides the means for accurate simulations of ligament volumetric material behavior without the need to resort to micromechanical or homogenization methods, thus facilitating its use in large scale, whole joint models.},

	abstract = {Restricted range of motion and excessive laxity are both potential complications of total knee arthroplasty (TKA). During TKA surgery, the surgeon is frequently faced with the question of how tightly to implant the prosthesis. The most common method of altering implantation tightness is to vary the thickness of the polyethylene inlay after the bone cuts have been made and the trial components inserted. We have sought to quantify how altering the polyethylene thickness may affect post-operative soft tissue tension for a range of prosthetic designs.

Four different prosthetic designs were implanted into fresh-frozen cadaveric knee joints. All four designs were implanted in the standard manner, with a 100 Newton distraction force used to set soft tissue balance. The tibiofemoral force was then recorded at 15° intervals throughout the passive flexion range. After the standard implantation of each prosthesis, the tibial component was raised or lowered to mimic increasing and decreasing the polyethylene thickness by 2 mm and the force measurements repeated.

Tibiofemoral force in extension correlated with implantation tightness for all prosthesis designs. Between 15° and 90°of knee flexion, all four designs were insensitive to changes in implantation tightness. Beyond 90° the effect was more notable in rotating platform mobile-bearing and cruciate-retaining prostheses than in posterior-stabilised mobile-bearing designs.

The findings of this research may be useful in assisting surgical decision-making during the implantation of TKA prostheses.},

The objective of this study was to investigate the length changes of different portions (anterior, middle and posterior) of the sMCL, dMCL and LCL during in vivo weightbearing flexion from full extension to maximal knee flexion. Methods Using a dual fluoroscopic imaging system, eight healthy knees were imaged while performing a lunge from full extension to maximal flexion. The length changes of each portion of the collateral ligaments were measured along the flexion path of the knee. Results All anterior portions of the collateral ligaments were shown to have increasing length with flexion except that of the sMCL, which showed a reduction in length at high flexion. The middle portions showed minimal change in lengths except that of the sMCL, which showed a consistent reduction in length with flexion. All posterior portions showed reduction in lengths with flexion. Conclusions These data indicated that every portion of the ligaments may play important roles in knee stability at different knee flexion range. The soft tissue releasing during TKA may need to consider the function of the ligament portions along the entire flexion path including maximum flexion. Level of evidence III.},

	abstract = {The biomechanics and function of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) have been widely studied using both experimental and simulation methods. It is known that a constitutive model of joint tissue is a critical factor in the numerical simulation. Some different ligament constitutive models have been presented to describe the ACL material behavior. However, the effect of the variation in the ligament constitutive model on joint kinematics and biomechanics has still not been studied. In this paper, a three-dimensional finite element model of an intact tibiofemoral joint was reconstructed. Three ACL constitutive models were compared under different joint loads (such as anterior tibial force, varus tibial torque, and valgus tibial torque) to investigate the effect of the change of the ACL constitutive model. The three constitutive models corresponded to an isotropic hyperelasticity model, a transversely isotropic hyperelasticity model with neo-Hookean ground substance description, and a transversely isotropic hyperelastic model with nonlinear ground substance description. Although the material properties of these constitutive equations were fitted on the same uniaxial tension stress-strain curve, the change of the ACL material constitutive model was found to induce altered joint kinematics and biomechanics. The effect of different ACL constitutive equations on joint kinematics depended on both deformation direction and load type. The variation in the ACL constitutive models would influence the joint kinematic results greatly in both the anterior and internal directions under anterior tibial force as well as some other deformations such as the anterior and medial tibial translations under valgus tibial torque, and the medial tibial translation and internal rotation under varus torque. It was revealed that the transversely isotropic hyperelastic model with nonlinear ground substance description (FE model III) was the best representation of the realistic ACL property by a linear regression between the simulated and the experiment deformation results. But the comparison of the predicted and experiment force of ligaments showed that all the three ACL constitutive models represented similar force results. The stress value and distribution of ACL were also altered by the change in the constitutive equation. In brief, although different ACL constitutive models have been fitted using the same uniaxial tension curve and have the similar longitudinal material property, the ACL constitutive equation should still be carefully chosen to investigate joint kinematics and biomechanics due to the different transverse material behavior.},

In four cadaveric knees the ACL was released at the tibial insertion, after which it was re-connected to a tensiometer. After pre-tensioning (10 N) the ACL in full-extension, the knee was flexed from 0° to 150° at 15° increments, during which the ACL tension was measured. At each angle the ACL was subsequently elongated and shortened under displacement control, while measuring the ACL tension. In this manner, the pre-tension or the slackness, and the mechanical response of the ACL were measured. All ACL's displayed a higher tension at low (0°–60°) and high (120°–150°) flexion angles. The ACL slackness depended on flexion angle, with the highest slackness found at 75°–90°. Additionally, the ACL stiffness also varied with flexion angle, with the ACL behaving stiffer at low and high flexion angels. In general, the ACL was stiffest at 150°, and most compliant at 90°. The results of this study contribute to understanding the mechanical behavior of the ACL in-situ, and may help tuning and validating computational knee models studying ACL function.},

	abstract = {Background
Accurate knowledge about the length variation of the knee ligaments (ACL, PCL, MCL and LCL) and the popliteal complex during knee flexion/extension is essential for modelling and clinical applications. The aim of the present study is to provide this information by using an original technique able to faithfully reproduce the continuous passive knee flexion–extension kinematics and to reliably identify each ligament/tendon attachment site.
Methods
Twelve lower limbs (femur, tibia, fibula, patella) were tested and set in motion (0–120°) using an ad hoc rig. Tibio-femoral kinematics was obtained using an optoelectronic system. A 3D digital model of each bone was obtained using low-dosage stereoradiography. Knee specimens were dissected and the insertion of each ligament and popliteal complex were marked with radio opaque paint. ACL, PCL and MCL were separated into two bundles. Bone epiphyses were CT-scanned to obtain a digital model of each ligament insertion. Bones and attachment site models were registered and the end-to-end distance variation of each ligament/tendon was computed over knee flexion.
Results
A tibial internal rotation of 18° ± 4° with respect to the femur was observed. The different bundles of the ACL, MCL and LCL shortened, whereas all bundles of the PCL lengthened. The popliteal complex was found to shorten until 30° of knee flexion and then to lengthen.
Conclusion
The end-to-end distance variation of the knee ligaments and popliteal complex can be estimated during knee flexion using a robust and reliable method based on marking the ligaments/tendon insertions with radiopaque paint.

	abstract = {The musculoskeletal ligament is a kind of multiscale composite material with collagen fibers embedded in a ground matrix. As the major constituent in ligaments to bear external loads, collagens are composed mainly of two collagen contents with different mechanical properties, i.e., types I and III collagen. The constitutive relation of ligaments plays a critical role in the stability and normal function of human joints. However, collagen types have not been distinguished in the previous constitutive relations. In this paper a constitutive relation for ligament tissues was modified based on the previous constitutive relation by considering the effects of collagen types. Both the collagen contents and the mechanical properties of sixteen ligament specimens from four cadaveric human knee joints were measured for determining their material coefficients in the constitutive relation. The mechanical behaviors of ligaments were obtained from both the uniaxial tensile and simple shear tests. A linear regression between joint kinematic results from in vitro and in silico experiments was made to validate the accuracy of this constitutive relation. The high correlation coefficient (R2=0.93) and significance (P\&lt;0.0001) of the regression equation revealed that this modified constitutive relation of ligaments was accurate to be used in studying joint biomechanics. Another finite element analysis with collagen contents changing demonstrated that the effect of variations in collagen ratios on both joint kinematics and ligament biomechanics could be simulated by this constitutive relation.},

	abstract = {The ligaments of the knee consist of fiber bundles with variable orientations, lengths and mechanical properties. In concept, however, these structures were too often seen as homogeneous structures, which are either stretched or slack during knee motions. In previous studies, we proposed a new structural concept of the ligaments of the knee. In this concept, the ligaments were considered as multi-bundle structures, with nonuniform mechanical properties and zero force lengths. The purpose of the present study was to verify this new concept.

For this purpose, laxity characteristics of a human knee joint were compared as measured in an experiment and predicted in a model simulation study. In the experiment, the varus-valgus and anterior-posterior laxities of a knee-joint specimen containing the ligaments and the articular surfaces only, were determined. From this knee-joint, geometric and mechanical parameters were derived to supply the parameters for a three-dimensional quasi-static knee-joint model. These parameters included (i) the three-dimensional insertion points of bundles, defined in the four major knee ligaments, (ii) the mechanical properties of these ligament, as functions of their relative insertion orientations and (iii) three-dimensional representations of the articular surfaces. With this model the experiments were simulated. If knee-model predictions and experimental results agree, then the multi-bundle ligament models are validated, at least with respect to their functional role in anterior-posterior and varus-valgus loading of the joint.

The model described the laxity characteristics in AP-translation and VV-rotation of the cadaveric knee-joint specimen reasonably well. Both display the same patterns of laxity changes during knee flexion. Only if a varus moment of 8 N m was applied and if the tibia was posteriorly loaded, did the model predict a slightly higher laxity than that measured experimentally.

From the model-experiment comparisons it was concluded that the proposed structural representations of the ligaments and their mechanical property distributions seem to be valid for studying the anterior-posterior and varus-valgus laxity characteristics of the human knee-joint.},

	abstract = {Accurate prediction of loads acting at the joint in total knee replacement (TKR) patients is key to developing experimental or computational simulations which evaluate implant designs under physiological loading conditions. In vivo joint loads have been measured for a small number of telemetric TKR patients, but in order to assess device performance across the entire patient population, a larger patient cohort is necessary. This study investigates the accuracy of predicting joint loads from joint kinematics. Specifically, the objective of the study was to assess the accuracy of internal–external (I–E) and anterior–posterior (A–P) joint load predictions from I–E and A–P motions under a given compressive load, and to evaluate the repeatability of joint load ratios (I–E torque to compressive force (I–E:C), and A–P force to compressive force (A–P:C)) for a range of compressive loading profiles. A tibiofemoral finite element model was developed and used to simulate deep knee bend, chair-rise and step-up activities for five patients. Root-mean-square (RMS) differences in I–E:C and A–P:C load ratios between telemetric measurements and model predictions were less than 1.10e–3 Nm/N and 0.035 N/N for all activities. I–E:C and A–P:C load ratios were consistently reproduced regardless of the compressive force profile applied (RMS differences less than 0.53e–3 Nm/N and 0.010 N/N, respectively). When error in kinematic measurement was introduced to the model, joint load predictions were forgiving to kinematic measurement error when conformity between femoral and tibial components was low. The prevalence of kinematic data, in conjunction with the analysis presented here, facilitates determining the scope of A–P and I–E joint loading ratios experienced by the TKR population.},

	abstract = {The ability to measure in vivo knee kinematics accurately makes it tempting to calculate in vivo contact forces, pressures, and areas directly from kinematic data. However, the sensitivity of contact calculations to kinematic measurement errors has not been adequately investigated. To address this issue, we developed a series of sensitivity analyses derived from a validated in vivo computational simulation of gait. The simulation used an elastic foundation contact model to reproduce in vivo contact force, center of pressure, and fluoroscopic motion data collected from an instrumented knee replacement. Treating each degree of freedom (DOF) in the simulation as motion controlled, we first quantified how errors in measured relative pose of the implant components affected contact calculations. Pose variations of ±0.1 mm or degree over the entire gait cycle changed maximum contact force, pressure, and area by 204, 100, and 117\%, respectively. Larger variations of ±0.5 mm or degree changed these same quantities by 1157, 108, and 578\%, respectively. In both cases, the largest sensitivities were to errors in superior-inferior translation and varus-valgus rotation, with loss of contact occurring on one or both sides. We then quantified how switching the sensitive DOFs from motion to load control affected the sensitivity results. Pose variations of ±0.5 mm or degree in the remaining DOFs changed maximum contact quantities by at most 3\%. These results suggest that accuracy on the order of microns and milliradians is needed to estimate contact forces, pressures, and areas directly from in vivo kinematic measurements, and that use of load rather than motion control for the sensitive DOFs may improve the accuracy of in vivo contact calculations. © 2008 Orthopaedic Research Society.

The geometrical model of the ACL was built from experimental measurements performed on a cadaveric knee specimen which was also subjected to kinematics tests. These experiments were used to enforce the particular boundary conditions used in the numerical model. A previously developed transversely isotropic hyperelastic material model was implemented and the ability to pre-stress the ligament was also included. The model exhibited the key characteristics of connective soft tissues: anisotropy, nonlinear behaviour, large strains, very high compliance for compressive or bending loading along the collagen fibres and incompressibility. Simulations of passive knee flexion were performed, with and without pre-stressing the ACL. The resultant force generated by the ACL was monitored and the results compared to existing experimental data. The stress distribution within the ligament was also assessed. When the ACL was pre-stressed, there was a good correlation between the predicted and experimental resultant forces reported in the literature over the entire flexion–extension range. The stress distribution in the pre-stressed and stress-free ACL were similar, although the magnitudes in the pre-stressed ACL were higher, particularly at low flexion angles.},

We created a subject-specific knee model of an 83-year-old male who had an instrumented TKR. The knee model was incorporated into a lower extremity musculoskeletal model and included deformable contact, ligamentous structures, and six degrees-of-freedom (DOF) tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joints. A novel numerical optimization technique was used to simultaneously predict muscle forces, secondary knee kinematics, ligament forces, and joint contact pressures from standard gait analysis data collected on the subject. The nominal knee model predictions of medial, lateral, and total contact forces during gait agreed well with TKR measures, with root-mean-square (rms) errors of 0.23, 0.22, and 0.33 body weight (BW), respectively. Coronal plane component alignment did not affect total knee contact loads, but did alter the medial–lateral load distribution, with 4 deg varus and 4 deg valgus rotations in component alignment inducing +17\% and −23\% changes in the first peak medial tibiofemoral contact forces, respectively. A Monte Carlo analysis showed that uncertainties in ligament stiffness and reference strains induce ±0.2 BW uncertainty in tibiofemoral force estimates over the gait cycle. Ligament properties had substantial influence on the TKR load distributions, with the medial collateral ligament and iliotibial band (ITB) properties having the largest effects on medial and lateral compartment loading, respectively. The computational framework provides a viable approach for virtually designing TKR components, considering parametric uncertainty and predicting the effects of joint alignment and soft tissue balancing procedures on TKR function during movement.},

	abstract = {In order to evaluate the contribution of the knee ligaments to restrain joint motions, knowledge about their structural properties is required. Due to the variable relative insertion orientation of the ligaments during knee motion, however, different fiber bundles are recruited, each with their specific mechanical properties. Hence, the structural properties vary as a function of knee motion. For this reason, a relationship between the structural tensile properties and the relative insertion orientation is required in order to define the role of the ligaments in knee mechanics. In the present study, this relationship is determined by performing a series of tensile tests in which the relative orientations of the insertion sites of human knee bone-ligament-bone preparations were varied systematically.

The experimentally obtained stiffness was significantly affected by the relative orientation of the insertion sites, but more profoundly for the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments (ACL and PCL) as compared to the medial and lateral collateral ligaments (MCL and LCL). The average decreases in stiffness per 5° tilt of the insertion sites were estimated at −11.6 ± 3.5 N mm−1 (ACL), −20.9 ± 2.7 N mm−1 (PCL), −2.6 ± 0.9 N mm−1 (MCL) and −3.7 ± 0.3 N mm−1 (LCL). For the PCL and the MCL these changes in stiffness with tilt were rather insensitive to the side of the femoral insertion site which was lifted. The ACL and the LCL, conversely, displayed significant differences in stiffness changes between the different tilt directions.

It is shown that the results of ligament tensile tests, particularly of the cruciate ligaments, are extremely sensitive to the orientation of the specimens in the loading apparatus. Since there is bound to be a variation in ligament orientations in earlier tensile studies, the variation in properties reported can be explained. It is concluded that the functional roles of the ligaments, particularly the cruciate ligaments, vary considerably during knee motions. Hence, functionally speaking, there is no such thing as ‘the ligament stiffness’.},

	abstract = {Background

The posterolateral graft has been reported to fail more frequently than the anteromedial graft in double-bundle ACL reconstructions. This study investigated the graft kinematics using a 3D modelling technique.


Methods

Twenty subjects performed a stair-ascending activity under dual fluoroscopy surveillance. A double-bundle ACL reconstruction was simulated on those healthy knees using an anteromedial portal technique. The graft–tunnel interaction was described using the graft–tunnel angle and the range of the graft–tunnel edge contact (GTEC).


Results

The femoral graft–tunnel angle of the anteromedial/posterolateral graft was 97.6 ± 7.5/100.7 ± 7.7° and the tibial graft–tunnel angle was 158.8 ± 6.5/146.5 ± 8.9° at knee extension. The femoral GTEC ranges were 23.2 ± 5.3–28.1 ± 7.6° for both grafts and the tibial GTEC ranges were 27.3 ± 2.2–34.5 ± 2.1° during stair-ascending.


Conclusion

The femoral graft–tunnel angle was larger than on the tibial side and the GTEC angles influenced the PL graft more, implying that grafts may experience a less optimal biomechanical environment at the femoral tunnels. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Although variability in connective tissue parameters is widely reported and recognized, systematic examination of the effect of such parametric uncertainties on predictions derived from a full anatomical joint model is lacking. As such, a sensitivity analysis was performed to consider the behavior of a three-dimensional, non-linear, finite element knee model with connective tissue material parameters that varied within a given interval. The model included the coupled mechanics of the tibio-femoral and patello-femoral degrees of freedom. Seven primary connective tissues modeled as non-linear continua, articular cartilages described by a linear elastic model, and menisci modeled as transverse isotropic elastic materials were included. In this study, a multi-factorial global sensitivity analysis is proposed, which can detect the contribution of influential material parameters while maintaining the potential effect of parametric interactions. To illustrate the effect of material uncertainties on model predictions, exemplar loading conditions reported in a number of isolated experimental paradigms were used. Our findings illustrated that the inclusion of material uncertainties in a coupled tibio-femoral and patello-femoral model reveals biomechanical interactions that otherwise would remain unknown. For example, our analysis revealed that the effect of anterior cruciate ligament parameter variations on the patello-femoral kinematic and kinetic response sensitivities was significantly larger, over a range of flexion angles, when compared to variations associated with material parameters of tissues intrinsic to the patello-femoral joint. We argue that the systematic sensitivity framework presented herein will help identify key material uncertainties that merit further research and provide insight on those uncertainties that may not be as relative to a given response.},

	abstract = {Healthy patellofemoral (PF) joint mechanics are critical to optimal function of the knee joint. Patellar maltracking may lead to large joint reaction loads and high stresses on the articular cartilage, increasing the risk of cartilage wear and the onset of osteoarthritis. While the mechanical sources of PF joint dysfunction are not well understood, links have been established between PF tracking and abnormal kinematics of the tibiofemoral (TF) joint, specifically following cruciate ligament injury and repair. The objective of this study was to create a validated finite element (FE) representation of the PF joint in order to predict PF kinematics and quadriceps force across healthy and pathological specimens. Measurements from a series of dynamic in-vitro cadaveric experiments were used to develop finite element models of the knee for three specimens. Specimens were loaded under intact, ACL-resected and both ACL and PCL-resected conditions. Finite element models of each specimen were constructed and calibrated to the outputs of the intact knee condition, and subsequently used to predict PF kinematics, contact mechanics, quadriceps force, patellar tendon moment arm and patellar tendon angle of the cruciate resected conditions. Model results for the intact and cruciate resected trials successfully matched experimental kinematics (avg. RMSE 4.0°, 3.1 mm) and peak quadriceps forces (avg. difference 5.6\%). Cruciate resections demonstrated either increased patellar tendon loads or increased joint reaction forces. The current study advances the standard for evaluation of PF mechanics through direct validation of cruciate-resected conditions including specimen-specific representations of PF anatomy.},

	abstract = {Multiple computational models have been developed to study knee biomechanics. However, the majority of these models are mainly validated against a limited range of loading conditions and/or do not include sufficient details of the critical anatomical structures within the joint. Due to the multifactorial dynamic nature of knee injuries, anatomic finite element (FE) models validated against multiple factors under a broad range of loading conditions are necessary. This study presents a validated FE model of the lower extremity with an anatomically accurate representation of the knee joint. The model was validated against tibiofemoral kinematics, ligaments strain/force, and articular cartilage pressure data measured directly from static, quasi-static, and dynamic cadaveric experiments. Strong correlations were observed between model predictions and experimental data (r {\textgreater} 0.8 and p {\textless} 0.0005 for all comparisons). FE predictions showed low deviations (root-mean-square (RMS) error) from average experimental data under all modes of static and quasi-static loading, falling within 2.5 deg of tibiofemoral rotation, 1\% of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL) strains, 17 N of ACL load, and 1 mm of tibiofemoral center of pressure. Similarly, the FE model was able to accurately predict tibiofemoral kinematics and ACL and MCL strains during simulated bipedal landings (dynamic loading). In addition to minimal deviation from direct cadaveric measurements, all model predictions fell within 95\% confidence intervals of the average experimental data. Agreement between model predictions and experimental data demonstrates the ability of the developed model to predict the kinematics of the human knee joint as well as the complex, nonuniform stress and strain fields that occur in biological soft tissue. Such a model will facilitate the in-depth understanding of a multitude of potential knee injury mechanisms with special emphasis on ACL injury.},

The objective of this study was to use a multibody knee model to investigate the influence of ligament properties on tibiofemoral kinematics and cartilage contact pressures in the stance phase of walking. The knee model included 14 ligament bundles and articular cartilage contact acting across the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joints. The knee was incorporated into a lower extremity musculoskeletal model and was used to simulate knee mechanics during the stance phase of normal walking. A Monte Carlo approach was employed to assess the influence of ligament stiffness and reference strain on knee mechanics. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), and posterior capsule properties exhibited significant influence on anterior tibial translation at heel strike, with the ACL acting as the primary restraint to anterior translation in mid-stance. The MCL and lateral collateral ligament (LCL) exhibited the greatest influence on tibial rotation from heel strike through mid-stance. Simulated tibial plateau contact location was dependent on the ACL, MCL, and LCL properties, while pressure magnitudes were most dependent on the ACL. A decrease in ACL stiffness or reference strain significantly increased the average contact pressure in mid-stance, with the pressure migrating posteriorly on the medial tibial plateau. These ligament-dependent shifts in tibiofemoral cartilage contact during walking are potentially relevant to consider when investigating the causes of early-onset osteoarthritis following knee ligament injury and surgical treatment.},

However, it is unknown if the two bundles of the ACL exhibit distinct time-dependent properties and microstructural organization, which have important implications for fully understanding the structure-function relationships of this oft-injured ligament. The goal of this study was to quantify the viscoelastic material properties and collagen fiber alignment of the AM and PL bundles in 16 human ACLs during stress-relaxation mechanical tests using the quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) model and a quantitative polarization imaging technique. We hypothesized that the AM and PL bundles would exhibit differences in the instantaneous mechanical and organizational properties (i.e., immediately following a step increase in strain), but similar time-dependent changes during stress-relaxation. Results showed that AM samples exhibited larger peak/equilibrium stresses and less stress-relaxation during a 300-s hold compared to PL samples. The AM bundle demonstrated stronger and more uniform collagen fiber alignment (i.e., higher degree of linear polarization (DoLP) values and less distributed angle of polarization (AoP) values) compared to the PL bundle, and larger changes in alignment strength during the hold. Results suggest that the AM bundle is the more “dominant” bundle, with significantly different mechanical and material properties in stress-relaxation. While more research is needed to better understand how these findings relate to the pathophysiology of ACL tears and can best guide treatment, the findings provide additional insight into the microstructural properties and biomechanics of the human ACL.},

	abstract = {Background
The pathogenesis of osteoarthritis following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is currently unknown. The study purpose was to leverage recent advances in quantitative and dynamic MRI to test the hypothesis that abnormal joint mechanics within four years of reconstruction is accompanied by evidence of early compositional changes in cartilage.
Methods
Static MR imaging was performed bilaterally on eleven subjects with an ACL reconstruction (1–4 years post-surgery) and on twelve healthy subjects to obtain tibial cartilage thickness maps. Quantitative imaging (mcDESPOT) was performed unilaterally on all subjects to assess the fraction of bound water in the tibial plateau cartilage. Finally, volumetric dynamic imaging was performed to assess cartilage contact patterns during an active knee flexion–extension task. A repeated-measures ANOVA was used to test for the effects of surgical reconstruction and location on cartilage thickness, bound water fractions, and contact across the medial and lateral tibia plateaus.
Findings
No significant differences in cartilage thickness were found between groups. However, there was a significant reduction in the fraction of water bound by proteoglycan in the ACL reconstructed knees, most notably along the anterior portion of the medial plateau and the weight-bearing lateral plateau. During movement, reconstructed knees exhibited greater contact along the medial spine in the medial plateau and along the posterior aspect of the lateral plateau, when compared with their healthy contralateral knees and healthy controls.
Interpretation
This study provides evidence that abnormal mechanics in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed knees are present coincidently with early biomarkers of cartilage degeneration.},

	abstract = {During knee motion, the fiber bundles of ligaments are nonuniformly loaded in a recruitment pattern which is different for successive knee-joint positions. As a result, the restraining functions of these ligaments are variable. To analyze the relative restraint contributions of the fiber bundles in different knee-joint positions, a new method was developed. Its application was illustrated for the cruciate ligaments of one knee-joint specimen. The methods developed to estimate bundle forces comprise five steps. First, the three-dimensional motions of a knee specimen are measured for anterior-posterior forces, using Röntgen Stereophotogrammetric Analysis. Second, bone-ligament-bone tensile tests are performed to evaluate the mechanical properties of these structures in several relative orientations of the bones. Third, multiple fiber bundles are identified in each ligament, based on the main fiber orientations. Fourth, the nonlinear force-length relationship of each functional bundle, as defined by a stiffness and a recruitment parameter, is determined by combining the multidirectional tensile tests with a multiline-element ligament model. Finally, the information obtained is combined in a whole-joint computer model of the knee, to determine the internal forces in the initial kinematic experiment, using an inverse dynamics approach. The technique appeared to be extremely time consuming and technologically involved. However, it was demonstrated to be useful and effective. The preliminary results reveal that the fiber bundle restraints are extremely sensitive to the knee flexion angle and the restraining forces are highly variable within the ligaments. For both cruciate ligaments, a gradual transition was demonstrated in load transfer from the posterior bundles to the more anteriorly positioned ones during knee flexion. Furthermore, it appeared that relatively high rorces were carried by only a few fiber bundles at each flexion angle. Based on these preliminary results, it is concluded that the determination of forces in multiple ligament bundles is important for the understanding of failure mechanisms of ligaments. In particular, alternate loading of different fiber bundles suggests that successful operative reconstruction of the cruciate ligaments may not be achieved simply by a one-bundle preparation.},

	abstract = {Verified and efficient representations of knee ligamentous constraints are essential to forward-dynamic models for prediction of knee mechanics. The objectives of this study were to develop an efficient probabilistic representation of knee ligamentous constraint using the advanced mean value (AMV) probabilistic approach, and to compare the AMV representation with the gold standard Monte Carlo (MC) approach. Specifically, the effects of inherent uncertainty in ligament stiffness, reference strain and attachment site locations on joint constraint were assessed. An explicit finite element model of the knee was evaluated under a series of anterior-posterior (AP) and internal-external (IE) loading at full extension and 90° flexion. Distributions of AP and IE laxity were predicted using experimentally-based levels of ligament parameter variability. Importance factors identified the critical properties affecting the predicted bounds, and agreed with reported ligament recruitment. The AMV method agreed closely with MC results with a four-fold reduction in computation time.},

	abstract = {Modeling complex knee biomechanics is a continual challenge, which has resulted in many models of varying levels of quality, complexity, and validation. Beyond modeling healthy knees, accurately mimicking pathologic knee mechanics, such as after cruciate rupture or meniscectomy, is difficult. Experimental tests of knee laxity can provide important information about ligament engagement and overall contributions to knee stability for development of subject-specific models to accurately simulate knee motion and loading. Our objective was to provide combined experimental tests and finite-element (FE) models of natural knee laxity that are subject-specific, have one-to-one experiment to model calibration, simulate ligament engagement in agreement with literature, and are adaptable for a variety of biomechanical investigations (e.g., cartilage contact, ligament strain, in vivo kinematics). Calibration involved perturbing ligament stiffness, initial ligament strain, and attachment location until model-predicted kinematics and ligament engagement matched experimental reports. Errors between model-predicted and experimental kinematics averaged {\textless}2 deg during varus–valgus (VV) rotations, {\textless}6 deg during internal–external (IE) rotations, and {\textless}3 mm of translation during anterior–posterior (AP) displacements. Engagement of the individual ligaments agreed with literature descriptions. These results demonstrate the ability of our constraint models to be customized for multiple individuals and simultaneously call attention to the need to verify that ligament engagement is in good general agreement with literature. To facilitate further investigations of subject-specific or population based knee joint biomechanics, data collected during the experimental and modeling phases of this study are available for download by the research community.},

	abstract = {In 1879, the French surgeon Segond described the existence of a ‘pearly, resistant, fibrous band’ at the anterolateral aspect of the human knee, attached to the eponymous Segond fracture. To date, the enigma surrounding this anatomical structure is reflected in confusing names such as ‘(mid-third) lateral capsular ligament’, ‘capsulo-osseous layer of the iliotibial band’ or ‘anterolateral ligament’, and no clear anatomical description has yet been provided. In this study, the presence and characteristics of Segond's ‘pearly band’, hereafter termed anterolateral ligament (ALL), was investigated in 41 unpaired, human cadaveric knees. The femoral and tibial attachment of the ALL, its course and its relationship with nearby anatomical structures were studied both qualitatively and quantitatively. In all but one of 41 cadaveric knees (97\%), the ALL was found as a well-defined ligamentous structure, clearly distinguishable from the anterolateral joint capsule. The origin of the ALL was situated at the prominence of the lateral femoral epicondyle, slightly anterior to the origin of the lateral collateral ligament, although connecting fibers between the two structures were observed. The ALL showed an oblique course to the anterolateral aspect of the proximal tibia, with firm attachments to the lateral meniscus, thus enveloping the inferior lateral geniculate artery and vein. Its insertion on the anterolateral tibia was grossly located midway between Gerdy's tubercle and the tip of the fibular head, definitely separate from the iliotibial band (ITB). The ALL was found to be a distinct ligamentous structure at the anterolateral aspect of the human knee with consistent origin and insertion site features. By providing a detailed anatomical characterization of the ALL, this study clarifies the long-standing enigma surrounding the existence of a ligamentous structure connecting the femur with the anterolateral tibia. Given its structure and anatomic location, the ALL is hypothesized to control internal tibial rotation and thus to affect the pivot shift phenomenon, although further studies are needed to investigate its biomechanical function.},

Whole joint knee simulators, like the Kansas knee simulator (KKS), provide a controlled and repeatable loading environment for comparative evaluation of component designs or surgical alignment under dynamic conditions. Experimental testing, however, is time and cost prohibitive for design-phase evaluation of tens or hundreds of design variations. Experimentally-verified computational models provide an efficient platform for analysis of multiple components, sizes, and alignment conditions. The purpose of the current study was to develop and verify a computational model of a dynamic, whole joint knee simulator. Experimental internal–external and valgus–varus laxity tests, followed by dynamic deep knee bend and gait simulations in the KKS were performed on three cadaveric specimens. Specimen-specific finite element (FE) models of posterior-stabilized TKR were created from magnetic resonance images and CAD geometry. The laxity data was used to optimize mechanical properties of tibiofemoral soft-tissue structures on a specimen-specific basis. Each specimen was subsequently analyzed in a computational model of the experimental KKS, simulating both dynamic activities. The computational model represented all joints and actuators in the experimental setup, including a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller to drive quadriceps actuation. The computational model was verified against six degree-of-freedom patellofemoral (PF) and tibiofemoral (TF) kinematics and actuator loading during both deep knee bend and gait activities, with good agreement in trends and magnitudes between model predictions and experimental kinematics; differences were less than 1.8 mm and 2.2° for PF and TF translations and rotations. The whole joint FE simulator described in this study can be applied to investigate a wide range of clinical and research questions.},

	abstract = {Background
In total knee surgery, typically the bone cuts are made first to produce the correct overall alignment. This is followed by balancing, often using spacer blocks to obtain equal parallel gaps in flexion and extension. Recently an electronically instrumented tibial trial has been introduced, which measures lateral and medial contact forces. The goal of our study was to determine the effect of different surgical variables; changing component sizes, modifying bone cuts, or ligament releases; on the contact forces, as a method to achieve balancing.
Methods
A special rig was designed to fit on a standard operating table, on which tests on 10 lower extremity specimens were carried out. After making bone cuts for a posterior cruciate retaining knee using a navigation system, tibial thickness was determined in extension using the Sag Test. Different Surgical Variables were then implemented, and the changes in the condylar forces were determined throughout flexion using the Heel Push Test.
Results
condylar forces were found to consist of gravity forces due to the weight of the leg plus forces due to pretension in the collateral ligaments. The pretension force averaged 145 N but there was considerable variation because of ligament stiffness properties. Balancing from an imbalanced state could be achieved with adjustments within only 2° or 2 mm.
Conclusion
The instrumented tibial trial provided force information which indicated which surgical correction options to carry out to achieve balancing. From an initial unbalanced state, relatively small changes could produce balancing, indicating the sensitivity of the procedure.
Clinical Relevance
Non-clinical. This study will assist in the balancing of the knee at total knee replacement surgery.},

	abstract = {Rigid body total knee replacement (TKR) models with tibiofemoral contact based on elastic foundation (EF) theory utilize simple contact pressure-surface overclosure relationships to estimate joint mechanics, and require significantly less computational time than corresponding deformable finite element (FE) methods. However, potential differences in predicted kinematics between these representations are currently not well understood, and it is unclear if the estimates of contact area and pressure are acceptable. Therefore, the objectives of the current study were to develop rigid EF and deformable FE models of tibiofemoral contact, and to compare predicted kinematics and contact mechanics from both representations during gait loading conditions with three different implant designs. Linear and nonlinear contact pressure-surface overclosure relationships based on polyethylene material properties were developed using EF theory. All other variables being equal, rigid body FE models accurately estimated kinematics predicted by fully deformable FE models and required only 2\% of the analysis time. As expected, the linear EF contact model sufficiently approximated trends for peak contact pressures, but overestimated the deformable results by up to 30\%. The nonlinear EF contact model more accurately reproduced trends and magnitudes of the deformable analysis, with maximum differences of approximately 15\% at the peak pressures during the gait cycle. All contact area predictions agreed in trend and magnitude. Using rigid models, edge-loading conditions resulted in substantial overestimation of peak pressure. Optimal nonlinear EF contact relationships were developed for specific TKR designs for use in parametric or repetitive analyses where computational time is paramount. The explicit FE analysis method utilized here provides a unique approach in that both rigid and deformable analyses can be run from the same input file, thus enabling simple selection of the most appropriate representation for the analysis of interest.},

	abstract = {Understanding the contribution of the soft-tissues to total joint constraint (TJC) is important for predicting joint kinematics, developing surgical procedures, and increasing accuracy of computational models. Previous studies on the collateral ligaments have focused on quantifying strain and tension properties under discrete loads or kinematic paths; however, there has been little work to quantify collateral ligament contribution over a broad range of applied loads and range of motion (ROM) in passive constraint. To accomplish this, passive envelopes were collected from nine cadaveric knees instrumented with implantable pressure transducers (IPT) in the collateral ligaments. The contributions from medial and lateral collateral ligaments (LCL) were quantified by the relative contribution of each structure at various flexion angles (0–120 deg) and compound external loads (±10 N m valgus, ±8 N m external, and ±40 N anterior). Average medial collateral ligament (MCL) contributions were highest under external and valgus torques from 60 deg to 120 deg flexion. The MCL showed significant contributions to TJC under external torques throughout the flexion range. Average LCL contributions were highest from 0 deg to 60 deg flexion under external and varus torques, as well as internal torques from 60 deg to 110 deg flexion. Similarly, these regions were found to have statistically significant LCL contributions. Anterior and posterior loads generally reduced collateral contribution to TJC; however, posterior loads further reduced MCL contribution, while anterior loads further reduced LCL contribution. These results provide insight to the functional role of the collaterals over a broad range of passive constraint. Developing a map of collateral ligament contribution to TJC may be used to identify the effects of injury or surgical intervention on soft-tissue, and how collateral ligament contributions to constraint correlate with activities of daily living.},

Predictions of mean knee cartilage contact pressures during normal gait reached 6.2 and 2.8 MPa on the medial tibial plateau and patellar facets, respectively.

	abstract = {Background: The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is composed of 2 functional bundles and has an essential role in knee function and stability. There is, however, a limited understanding of the role of each individual bundle through the full range of knee flexion.
Hypothesis: Both bundles provide restraint to posterior tibial translation across a full range of knee flexion. At higher angles of knee flexion ({\textgreater}90°), the intact PCL also imparts significant rotational stability.
Study Design: Controlled laboratory study.
Methods: Twenty matched-paired, human cadaveric knees (mean age, 55.2 years; range, 51-59 years; 6 male and 4 female pairs) were used to evaluate the kinematics of an intact, anterolateral bundle (ALB) sectioned, posteromedial bundle (PMB) sectioned, and complete PCL sectioned knee. A 6 degree of freedom robotic system was used to assess knee stability with an applied 134-N posterior tibial load, 5-N·m external and internal rotation torques, 10-N·m valgus and varus torques, and a coupled 100-N posterior tibial load and 5-N external rotation torque at 0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75°, 90°, 105°, and 120°.
Results: All sectioned states had significant increases compared with intact in posterior translation, internal rotation, and external rotation at all tested flexion angles, with the exception of the ALB sectioned state at 75° of flexion for external rotation. The significant increases (mean ± standard deviation) in posterior translation during a 134-N posterior tibial load at 90° of flexion were 0.9 ± 0.6 mm, 2.6 ± 1.8 mm, and 11.7 ± 4.0 mm for the PMB, ALB, and complete PCL sectioned states, respectively, compared with the intact state. The largest significant increases in internal rotation were in the PMB and complete PCL sectioned states at 105° of flexion, 1.3° ± 1.0° and 2.8° ± 2.1°, respectively.
Conclusion: Both the ALB and the PMB assume a significant role in resisting posterior tibial translation, at all flexion angles, suggesting a codominant relationship. The PCL provided a significant constraint to internal rotation beyond 90° of flexion.

	abstract = {The cruciate ligaments of the knee consist of numerous fascicles, groups of which comprise fibre bundles. The stabilising function of these ligaments is established by changes in the lengths and orientations of the fascicles. Understanding the function of knee ligaments thus requires an understanding of their 3-dimensional fascicle architecture. Hitherto, the cruciate ligaments have been considered functionally as single-dimensional 'ropes' or, at the most, as consisting of anterior and posterior parts. It is evident from the appearance of these ligamentous structures, however, that fascicles in more than 2 directions are present. This study investigated how many and which fibre bundles are minimally needed to preserve the main fascicle directions in the ligaments. An anatomical analysis of the cruciate ligaments was performed using a 3-dimensional measuring device. Three anterior and 3 posterior cruciate ligaments were isolated and their fascicles measures. Based on the courses of the fascicles, fibre bundles were defined, dissected bluntly, and their corresponding insertion sites measured. Finally, the insertion sites of the bundles were connected into straight-line representations by a computer and transformed to the anatomical position of the knee, so as to be useful for functional analyses of the ligaments. It was found that 6-10 bundles are sufficient to represent the main fascicle directions of the ligaments. Although the number of fibre bundles is not identical for all ligaments, the femur and the tibia are connected in a consistent way by these bundles. Even the ways in which the fibre bundles change their interrelationship from the femoral to the tibial insertion sites are comparable. The results serve as a detailed anatomical basis for functional analyses of the cruciate ligaments.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we sought to expand the fidelity of a validated model of the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R) procedure by incorporating a stick–slip contact model with linear pressure–overclosure relationship at the interface. The suggested model is characterized by three unknown parameters, friction coefficient, shear stress softening and contact stiffness. In the absence of any isolated experiments exploring the graft–tunnel interactions during an aggregate joint load, the calibration data used in this study are derived from a reported biomechanical study. A Bayesian calibration procedure was employed to find the unknown probability distribution function (PDF) of these contact parameters. Initially, the response surface approximations of the predicted graft forces from laxity test simulations was adopted to estimate the likelihood of noisy experimental data reported in the literature. Then, the wide domain of contact parameters was sampled sequentially based on the Marcov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with acceptance–rejection criteria to search for population of samples in significantly narrower domain of unknown parameters that are associated with the highest occurrence likelihood of noisy experimental data. Our simulations with calibrated contact parameters indicate that pre-tensioning applied at 30° of flexion leads to larger graft force after the joint is fully extended compared to the graft force when the same pre-tensioning force is applied at full extension. Moreover, regardless of the pre-tensioning force, the graft–tunnel contact pressure is larger when the fixation of the graft is performed at full extension, increasing with the pre-tensioning force.},

	abstract = {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely
limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the field of global optimization,
since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded.
One way to address this challenge is to fit response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the
objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization,
tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface
methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often
occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct
an efficient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response
surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by
sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where
prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which
have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be
overcome.},

The complex fiber anatomy of the cruciates may suggest a complex deformation behavior across the continuum of their substance that cannot be captured by only two measurement points. In this study, a new methodology was introduced to include more detailed fiber anatomy and to take into consideration the wrapping of the PCL around the intercondylar notch of the femur in deep flexion. The method was used in comparison to the conventional two-bundle models on three sample cadaver knees that underwent a passive flexion up to 150°. The elongation ratios of the bundles were measured as the ratio of change in the length of the bundles over their lengths at 0° flexion. The multiple-bundle models showed ranges of variations across the attachment sites of the cruciates which at all flexion angles were significantly larger than those observed from the conventional two-bundle models. When expressed in percentages, at 150° flexion the ranges of variations in the elongation ratio of the bundles were 32.7\% ± 31.9\% and 34\% ± 8.6\% for the ACL and PCL, respectively. Results of this study showed that important variations of elongation across the body of the cruciates can be obscured to the conventional two-bundle model of the cruciates, and therefore a more detailed bundle configuration is suggested for the purpose of studying elongation behaviors of these ligaments.},

	abstract = {Summary: The objective of this study was to provide quantitative data on the insertion sites of the cruciate ligaments. In the first part of the study, we determined the shapes and sizes of the insertions of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments (ACL and PCL), and further compared these data with the midsubstance cross-sectional areas of the ligaments. The cross-sectional area of the ACL and PCL midsubstance of 5 human knees was measured using a laser micrometer system. The insertion sites of each ligament were then digitized and the 2-dimensional insertion site areas were determined. Relative to the ligament midsubstance, the PCL tibial and femoral insertions were approximately 3 times larger, whereas those of the ACL were over 3.5 times larger. In the second part of the study, the ACLs and PCLs of 10 knees were each divided into their 2 components and the areas of each insertion were determined. Each component was approximately 50\% of the total ligament insertion area and no significant difference between the 2 could be shown.

The ACL is a key structure in the knee joint, as it resists anterior tibial translation and rotational loads. When the knee is extended, the ACL has a mean length of 32 mm and a width of 7–12 mm. There are two components of the ACL, the anteromedial bundle (AMB) and the posterolateral bundle (PLB). They are not isometric with the main change being lengthening of the AMB and shortening of the PLB during flexion. The ACL has a microstructure of collagen bundles of multiple types (mostly type I) and a matrix made of a network of proteins, glycoproteins, elastic systems, and glycosaminoglycans with multiple functional interactions. The complex ultrastructural organization and abundant elastic system of the ACL allow it to withstand multiaxial stresses and varying tensile strains. The ACL is innervated by posterior articular branches of the tibial nerve and is vascularized by branches of the middle genicular artery.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional mathematical models of the tibio-femoral joint require input of the geometry of articulating surfaces and ligament insertions, and the mechanical properties of cartilage and ligaments. This paper describes a validation of a knee model through a direct specimen-related comparison between the knee model and the kinematics of four knee joint specimens from which the geometry data were used as input of the model. The knee model is quasi-static and is based on equilibrium of forces and moments. The stiffness properties of the ligaments and articular cartilage were estimated on the basis of data reported in the literature. The so-called reference strains in the ligament bundles for the joint in extension, were determined by using an optimization procedure, minimizing the difference between the kinematics of the model and the kinematics of experimentally obtained flexion motions with an internally or an externally rotated tibia (±3 Nm load). A reasonable to good agreement between the model and the experimental kinematics could be obtained for internal-external rotation laxity and the coupled translations and varus-valgus rotation. The disparity between model and experiment varied from knee to knee, average deviations ranging from close to zero to 8° internal rotation deviation and from 5 mm posterior to 3 mm anterior position deviation. The average anterior-posterior laxities at both 20° and 90° flexion were within the variations reported in the literature, although for each individual joint with some underestimation or overestimation. It was concluded that the optimization procedure compensated for the lack of menisci and capsular structures by higher prestrains, thereby overestimating the ligament forces. Despite the gross simplifications relative to the complex anatomy of the knee, the present knee model can realistically simulate the passive motion characteristics of the human knee joint.},

	abstract = {This study introduces a framework for co-simulating neuromuscular dynamics and knee joint mechanics during gait. A knee model was developed that included 17 ligament bundles and a representation of the distributed contact between a femoral component and tibial insert surface. The knee was incorporated into a forward dynamics musculoskeletal model of the lower extremity. A computed muscle control algorithm was then used to modulate the muscle excitations to drive the model to closely track measured hip, knee, and ankle angle trajectories of a subject walking overground with an instrumented knee replacement. The resulting simulations predicted the muscle forces, ligament forces, secondary knee kinematics, and tibiofemoral contact loads. Model-predicted tibiofemoral contact forces were of comparable magnitudes to experimental measurements, with peak medial (1.95 body weight (BW)) and total (2.76 BW) contact forces within 4–17\% of measured values. Average root-mean-square errors over a gait cycle were 0.26, 0.42, and 0.51 BW for the medial, lateral, and total contact forces, respectively. The model was subsequently used to predict variations in joint contact pressure that could arise by altering the frontal plane joint alignment. Small variations (±2 deg) in the alignment of the femoral component and tibial insert did not substantially affect the location of contact pressure, but did alter the medio-lateral distribution of load and internal tibia rotation in swing. Thus, the computational framework can be used to virtually assess the coupled influence of both physiological and design factors on in vivo joint mechanics and performance.},

	abstract = {Background The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is the strongest ligament of the knee, serving as one of the major passive stabilizers of the tibio-femoral joint. However, despite a number of experimental and modelling approaches to understand the kinematics and kinetics of the ligament, the normal loading conditions of the PCL and its functional bundles are still controversially discussed.   Objectives This study aimed to generate science-based evidence for understanding the functional loading of the PCL, including the anterolateral and posteromedial bundles, in the healthy knee joint through systematic review and statistical analysis of the literature.   Data sources MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL   Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Databases were searched for articles containing any numerical strain or force data on the healthy PCL and its functional bundles. Studied activities were as follows: passive flexion, flexion under 100N and 134N posterior tibial load, walking, stair ascent and descent, body-weight squatting and forward lunge.   Method Statistical analysis was performed on the reported load data, which was weighted according to the number of knees tested to extract average strain and force trends of the PCL and identify deviations from the norms.   Results From the 3577 articles retrieved by the initial electronic search, only 66 met all inclusion criteria. The results obtained by aggregating data reported in the eligible studies indicate that the loading patterns of the PCL vary with activity type, knee flexion angle, but importantly also the technique used for assessment. Moreover, different fibres of the PCL exhibit different strain patterns during knee flexion, with higher strain magnitudes reported in the anterolateral bundle. While during passive flexion the posteromedial bundle is either lax or very slightly elongated, it experiences higher strain levels during forward lunge and has a synergetic relationship with the anterolateral bundle. The strain patterns obtained for virtual fibres that connect the origin and insertion of the bundles in a straight line show similar trends to those of the real bundles but with different magnitudes.   Conclusion This review represents what is now the best available understanding of the biomechanics of the PCL, and may help to improve programs for injury prevention, diagnosis methods as well as reconstruction and rehabilitation techniques.},

	abstract = {Background
Previous studies suggested that changes in kinematics in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) affected satisfaction level. The aim of this cadaveric study was to evaluate the effect of medial collateral ligament (MCL) release by multiple needle puncture on knee rotational kinematics in posterior-stabilized TKA.
Methods
Six fresh, frozen cadaveric knees were included in this study. All TKA procedures were performed with an image-free navigation system using a 10-mm polyethylene insert. Tibial internal rotation was assessed to evaluate intraoperative knee kinematics. Multiple needle puncturing was performed 5, 10, and 15 times for the hard portion of the MCL at 90° knee flexion. Kinematic analysis was performed after every 5 punctures. After performing 15 punctures, a 14-mm polyethylene insert was inserted, and kinematic analysis was performed.
Results
The tibial internal rotation angle at maximum knee flexion without multiple needle puncturing was significantly larger (9.42°) than that after 15 punctures (3°). Negative correlation (Pearson r = −0.715, P \&lt; .001) between tibial internal rotation angle at maximum knee flexion and frequency of puncture was observed. The tibial internal rotation angle with a 14-mm insert was significantly larger (7.25°) compared with the angle after 15 punctures.
Conclusion
Tibial internal rotation during knee flexion was reduced by extensive MCL release using multiple needle puncturing and was recovered by increasing of medial tightness. From the point of view of knee kinematics, medial tightness should be allowed to maintain the internal rotation angle of the tibia during knee flexion which might lead to patient satisfaction.},

	abstract = {Successful reconstruction of ligaments requires knowledge of the properties of the intact ligament. This study examined the strength of the human posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), treating it as two separate fibre bundles. It was hypothesized (i) that the mechanical and material properties of the anterolateral (aPC) and the posteromedial (pPC) bundles of the PCL were significantly different and (ii) that previous studies have underestimated the strength of the whole PCL. The properties of the two bundles were measured in 10 donors (53–98 yr). The mechanical and material properties of the two bundles were found to be significantly different, the aPC was six times as strong as the pPC. The aPC had a mean strength of 1.6 kN. Allowing for age effects this study suggests that the strength of the PCL in young active people is 4 kN, which is higher than that suggested by previous studies. Because of the difference in the strengths of the two bundles, we conclude that the aPC is primarily responsible for the stabilising effect of the PCL. We therefore recommend that PCL reconstructions should be centered on the middle of the aPC bundle.},

	abstract = {Experimental simulator studies are frequently performed to evaluate wear behavior in total knee replacement. It is vital that the simulation conditions match the physiological situation as closely as possible. To date, few experimental wear studies have examined the effects of joint laxity on wear and joint kinematics and the absence of the anterior cruciate ligament has not been sufficiently taken into account in simulator wear studies. The aim of this study was to investigate different ligament and soft tissue models with respect to wear and kinematics. A virtual soft tissue control system was used to simulate different motion restraints in a force-controlled knee wear simulator. The application of more realistic and sophisticated ligament models that considered the absence of anterior cruciate ligament lead to a significant increase in polyethylene wear (p=0.02) and joint kinematics (p{\textless}0.01). We recommend the use of more complex ligament models to appropriately simulate the function of the human knee joint and to evaluate the wear behavior of total knee replacements. A feasible simulation model is presented.},

	abstract = {Background: There is limited information regarding load responses of the posterior oblique and superficial medial collateral ligaments to applied loads., Hypotheses: The degree of knee flexion affects loads experienced by the posterior oblique ligament and both divisions of the superficial medial collateral ligament. The posterior oblique ligament provides significant resistance to valgus and internal rotation forces near knee extension. Different load responses are experienced by proximal and distal divisions of the superficial medial collateral ligament., Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study., Methods: Twenty-four nonpaired, fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were tested. Buckle transducers were applied to the proximal and distal divisions of the superficial medial collateral and posterior oblique ligaments. Applied loads at 0°, 20°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of knee flexion consisted of 10 N.m valgus loads, 5 N .m internal and external rotation torques, and 88 N anterior and posterior drawer loads., Results: External rotation torques produced a significantly higher load response on the distal superficial medial collateral ligament than did internal rotation torques at all flexion angles with the largest difference at 90° (96.6 vs 22.5 N). For an applied valgus load at 60° of knee flexion, loads on the superficial medial collateral ligament were significantly higher in the distal division (103.5 N) than the proximal division (71.9 N). The valgus load response of the posterior oblique ligament at 0° of flexion (19.1 N) was significantly higher than at 30° (10.6 N), 60° (7.8 N), and 90° (6.8 N) of flexion. At 0° of knee flexion, the load response to internal rotation on the posterior oblique ligament (45.8 N) was significantly larger than was the response on both divisions of the superficial medial collateral ligament (20 N for both divisions). At 90° of flexion, the load response to internal rotation torques reciprocated between these structures with a significantly higher response in the distal superficial medial collateral ligament division (22.5 N) than the posterior oblique ligament (9.1 N)., Conclusion: The superficial medial collateral ligament experienced the largest load response to applied valgus and external rotation torques; the posterior oblique ligament observed the highest load response to internal rotation near extension., Clinical Relevance: This study provides new knowledge of the individual biomechanical function of the main medial knee structures in an intact knee and will assist in the interpretation of clinical knee motion testing and provide evidence for techniques involving repair or reconstruction of the posterior oblique ligament and both divisions of the superficial medial collateral ligament.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews and updates our knowledge of the anatomy and biomechanics of the posterior cruciate ligament, and of the posterolateral, posteromedial and meniscofemoral ligaments of the knee. The posterior cruciate ligament is shown to have two functional fibre bundles that are tight at different angles of knee flexion. It is the primary restraint to tibial posterior draw at all angles of knee flexion apart from near full extension. In contrast, the posterolateral and posteromedial structures are shown to tighten as the knee extends, and to be well-aligned to resist tibial posterior draw. These structures also act as primary restraints against other tibial displacements. Tibial internal rotation is restrained by the medial and posteromedial structures, while tibial external rotation is restrained by the lateral and posterolateral structures. They are also the primary restraints against tibial abduction-adduction rotations. The meniscofemoral ligaments are shown, for the first time, to contribute significantly to resisting tibial posterior draw, and to have a strength of approximately 300 N. Taken together, this evidence shows how the posterolateral and posteromedial structures are responsible for posterior knee stability near extension, and this, along with the action of the meniscofemoral ligaments, may explain why an isolated rupture of the posterior cruciate ligament does not often lead to knee instability},

	abstract = {Though asymmetric loading between the medial and lateral compartments of total knee replacements may contribute to implant loosening and failure, the in vivo contact force distribution during dynamic daily activities remains unknown. This study reports in vivo medial and lateral contact forces experienced by a well-aligned knee implant for a variety of activities. In vivo implant motion and total axial load data were collected from a single knee replacement patient performing treadmill gait (hands resting on handlebars), step up/down, lunge, and kneel activities. In vivo motion was measured using video fluoroscopy, while in vivo axial loads were collected simultaneously using an instrumented tibial component. An elastic foundation contact model employing linear and nonlinear polyethylene material properties was constructed to calculate medial and lateral contact forces based on the measured kinematics, total axial loads, and centers of pressure. For all activities, the predicted medial and lateral contact forces were insensitive to the selected material model. The percentage of medial to total contact force ranged from 18 to 60 for gait, 47 to 65 for step up/down, and 55 to 60 for kneel and lunge. At maximum load during the motion cycle, medial force was 1.2 BW for gait and 2.0 BW for step up/down, while the corresponding lateral forces were 1.0 and 1.5 BW, respectively. At mean load in the final static pose, medial force was 0.2 BW for kneel and 0.9 BW for lunge, with corresponding lateral forces of 0.1 and 0.7 BW, respectively. For this patient, a constant load split of 55\% medial–45\% lateral during loaded activity would be a reasonable approximation for these test conditions. © 2007 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Muscle forces, ground reaction forces, and joint motions obtained from a dynamic optimization solution for normal walking were used as input to a three-dimensional model of the lower limb. A static equilibrium problem was solved at each instant of the gait cycle to determine tibiofemoral joint loading at the knee. Medial compartment loading was determined mainly by the orientation of the ground reaction force. Because this force vector passed medial to the knee, it applied an adduction moment about the joint during stance. In contrast, all of the force transmitted by the lateral compartment was due to muscle and ligament action. The muscles that contributed most to support and forward propulsion during normal walking (quadriceps and gastrocnemius) also contributed most to knee stability in the frontal plane. The knee ligaments, particularly those of the posterior lateral corner, provided stability to the knee at certain periods of the stance phase, when activity of the important stabilizing muscles was low. © 2006 Orthopaedic Research Society.

	abstract = {Patient-to-patient differences should be accounted for in both clinical evaluations and computational models of knee laxity. Accordingly, the objectives were to determine how variable the laxities are between knees by determining the range of the internal–external (I-E), varus–valgus (V-V), anterior–posterior (A-P), and compression–distraction (C-D) limits of passive motion, and how related the laxities are within a knee by determining whether these limits are correlated with one another. The limits in I-E (± 3 Nm), V-V (± 5 Nm), A-P (± 45 N), and C-D (± 100 N) were measured in 10 normal human cadaveric knees at 0° to 120° flexion in 15° increments using a six degree-of-freedom load application system. The ranges from 15° to 120° flexion of the I-E limits were greater than 3.6°, of the A-P limits were greater than 1.8 mm, and of the varus limits were greater than 1.4°. The ranges from 30° to 120° flexion of the distraction limits were greater than 2.0 mm. Twenty-four of the 28 pair-wise comparisons between the limits had a correlation coefficient less than 0.65. These results demonstrate that a patient-specific approach, including all degrees of freedom of interest, is necessary during clinical evaluations of laxity and when creating and validating computational models of the tibiofemoral joint. © 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Three cadaver knees were tested in a dynamic knee simulator. The cadaver knees also underwent manual envelope of motion testing to find their passive range of motion in order to determine the zero-load lengths for each ligament bundle. Computational multibody knee models were created for each knee and model kinematics were compared to experimental kinematics for a simulated walk cycle. One-dimensional non-linear spring damper elements were used to represent cruciate and collateral ligament bundles in the knee models. This study found that knee kinematics were highly sensitive to altering of the zero-load length. The results also suggest optimal methods for defining each of the ligament bundle zero-load lengths, regardless of the subject. These results verify the importance of the zero-load length when modeling the knee joint and verify that manual envelope of motion measurements can be used to determine the passive range of motion of the knee joint. It is also believed that the method described here for determining zero-load length can be used for in vitro or in vivo subject-specific computational models.},

	abstract = {Knee laxity, defined as the net translation or rotation of the tibia relative to the femur in a given direction in response to an applied load, is highly variable from person to person. High levels of knee laxity as assessed during routine clinical exams are associated with first-time ligament injury and graft reinjury following reconstruction. During laxity exams, ligaments carry force to resist the applied load; however, relationships between intersubject variations in knee laxity and variations in how ligaments carry force as the knee moves through its passive envelope of motion, which we refer to as ligament engagement, are not well established. Thus, the objectives of this study were, first, to define parameters describing ligament engagement and, then, to link variations in ligament engagement and variations in laxity across a group of knees. We used a robotic manipulator in a cadaveric knee model (n=20) to quantify how important knee stabilizers, namely the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments (ACL and PCL, respectively), as well as the medial collateral ligament (MCL) engage during respective tests of anterior, posterior, and valgus laxity. Ligament engagement was quantified using three parameters: (1) in situ slack, defined as the relative tibiofemoral motion from the neutral position of the joint to the position where the ligament began to carry force; (2) in situ stiffness, defined as the slope of the linear portion of the ligament force–tibial motion response; and (3) ligament force at the peak applied load. Knee laxity was related to parameters of ligament engagement using univariate and multivariate regression models. Variations in the in situ slack of the ACL and PCL predicted anterior and posterior laxity, while variations in both in situ slack and in situ stiffness of the MCL predicted valgus laxity. Parameters of ligament engagement may be useful to further characterize the in situ biomechanical function of ligaments and ligament grafts.},

However, it is unknown how these properties vary within each bundle.Purpose:To quantify mechanical and microstructural properties of samples within ACL bundles to elucidate any regional variation across the ligament. We hypothesized that there are no differences within each bundle in contrast to cross-bundle variation.Study Design:Descriptive laboratory study.Methods:Sixteen human ACLs were dissected into AM and PL bundles. Three samples were taken from each bundle in an ordered sequence from AM (region 1 AM bundle) to PL (region 6 PL bundle). Each sample was tested in uniaxial tension, using quantitative polarized light imaging (QPLI) to quantify collagen fiber alignment. After preconditioning, samples were subjected to a stress-relaxation (SR) test followed by quasistatic ramp-to-failure (RF). Peak and equilibrium stress values were computed from the SR test and modulus quantified in the toe- and linear-regions of the RF. QPLI values describing collagen orientation (angle of polarization [AoP]) and strength of alignment (degree of linear polarization [DoLP]) were computed for the SR test and at points corresponding to the zero, transition point, and linear region of the RF.Results:Toe- and linear-region modulus values decreased from region 1 to 6. Slopes of regression lines increased for the average DoLP during RF, with significance at higher strains. The standard deviation of AoP values decreased during RF, indicating tighter distribution of orientation angles, with significant correlations at all points of the RF. During SR, stress values uniformly decreased but did not show significant linear regression by region. DoLP and AoP values changed slightly during SR and demonstrated significant linear variation by region at both peak and equilibrium points.Conclusion:Most microstructural and material properties evaluated in this study appear to follow a linear gradient across the ACL, rather than varying by bundle.Clinical Relevance:This AM-to-PL variation provides a more accurate description of functional tissue anatomy and can be used to assess and guide techniques of ACL reconstruction.},

Sixty-five varus osteoarthritic patients underwent primary posterior-stabilized total knee arthroplasty using modified gap-balancing technique. The influence of joint distraction force on the soft-tissue balance measurement during the modified gap-balancing technique was evaluated with Offset Repo-Tensor between the osteotomized surfaces at extension, and between femoral posterior condyles and tibial osteotomized surface at flexion of the knee before the resection of femoral posterior condyles. The joint center gap (millimeters) and varus ligament balance (°) were measured under 20, 40, and 60 pounds of joint distraction forces, and the differences in these values at extension and flexion (the value at flexion minus the value at extension) were also calculated. The differences in joint center gap (−6.7, −6.8, and −6.9 mm for 20, 40, and 60 pounds, respectively) and varus ligament balance (3.5°, 3.8°, and 3.8°) at extension and flexion were not significantly different among different joint distraction forces, although the joint center gap and varus ligament balance significantly increased stepwise at extension and flexion as the joint distraction force increased. The difference in joint center gap and varus ligament balance at extension and flexion were consistent even among the different joint distraction forces. This novel index would be useful for the determination of femoral component rotation during the modified gap-balancing technique.},

	abstract = {Ligament sprains account for a majority of injuries to the foot and ankle complex, but ligament properties have not been understood well due to the difficulties in replicating the complex geometry, in situ stress state, and non-uniformity of the strain. For a full investigation of the injury mechanism, it is essential to build up a foot and ankle model validated at the level of bony kinematics and ligament properties. This study developed a framework to parameterize the ligament response for determining the in situ stress state and heterogeneous force–elongation characteristics using a finite element ankle model. Nine major ankle ligaments and the interosseous membrane were modeled as discrete elements corresponding functionally to the ligamentous microstructure of collagen fibers and having parameterized toe region and stiffness at the fiber level. The range of the design variables in the ligament model was determined from existing experimental data. Sensitivity of the bony kinematics to each variable was investigated by design of experiment. The results highlighted the critical role of the length of the toe region of the ligamentous fibers on the bony kinematics with the cumulative influence of more than 95\%, while the fiber stiffness was statistically insignificant with an influence of less than 1\% under the given variable range and loading conditions. With the flexibility of variable adjustment and high computational efficiency, the presented ankle model was generic in nature so as to maximize its applicability to capture the individual ligament behaviors in future studies.},

	abstract = {BackgroundLigament balancing is a challenging but essential part of successful total knee arthroplasty. There is general agreement that flexion and extension gaps should be equal and symmetrical. However, to date there are no available comparisons to physiologically normal knee joints that have not undergone bone resection. There are also no standards specifying which instruments (e.g., spacers, distractors, trial components, navigation systems) and particularly what degree of force should be used for gap distraction.MethodsTo measure the physiological extension and flexion gaps, a prototypical force-determining tensor (Aesculap, Tuttlingen, Germany) was constructed and adapted so that force could be applied directly through Schanz screws inserted medially and laterally on the tibia and femur, independent of each other and without the need for bony resection. Ten normal cadaveric knees were assessed using a standard medial parapatellar total knee arthroplasty approach with patellar subluxation. Gap measurements were carried out twice, alternating distraction forces of 100 and 200 N each time.ResultsThe prototype was implemented successfully. Repeat measurements showed only slight deviation from the original, resulting in minimal standard error. Precision did not vary with the application of greater force (200 N), but gap size increased significantly (p {\textless} 0.001).ConclusionsThe success of this assessment with cadaveric knees indicates that this prototype can be applied to measure flexion and extension gaps without the need for bony resection. Increasing the distraction force to 200 N does not improve results, so 100 N per compartment appears adequate. Most likely, the extension and flexion gaps are physiologically asymmetric and unequal, and the kinematics are markedly altered after resection of the PCL and/or ACL. This new force-determining tensor can be used for further analyses, e.g., to explore the effects of selective ligament resection.},

Gap measurements were carried out twice each alternating 100 and 200 N per compartment using a prototypical force-determining ligament balancer without the need for bony resection. Initial measurements were performed in extension, followed by 90° of flexion. The ACL was then resected, and finally the PCL was resected, and measurements were carried out in an analogous fashion. In general, the lateral compartment could be stretched further than the medial compartment, and the corresponding flexion gap values were significantly larger. ACL resection predominantly increased extension gaps, while PCL resection increased flexion gaps. Distraction force of 100 N per compartment appeared adequate; increasing to 200 N did not improve the results. © 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society. © 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine how the interaction between ligament tensions and contact forces guides the knee joint through its specific pattern of passive motion. A computer model was built based on cadaver data. The passive motion and the ligament lengthening and force patterns predicted by the model were verified with data from the literature. The contribution of each ligament and contact force was measured in terms of the rotational moment that it produced about the tibial medial plateau and the anterior-posterior (AP) force that it exerted on the tibia. The high tension of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the geometric constraints of the anterior horns of the menisci were found to be key features that stabilized the knee at full extension. The mutual effect of the cruciates was found as the reason for the screw-home mechanism at early flexion. Past 30 degrees, the AP component of contact force on the convex geometry of the lateral tibial plateau and tension of the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) were identified as elements that control the joint motion. From 60 degrees to 90 degrees, reduction in the tension of the ACL was determined as a reason for continuation of the tibial anterior translation. From 90 degrees to 120 degrees, increase in the tension of the posterior cruciate ligament and the AP component of the contact force on the convex geometry of the lateral tibial plateau pushed the tibia more anteriorly. This anterior translation was limited by the constraining effects of the ACL tension and the AP component of the contact force on the medial meniscus. The important guiding role observed for the LCL suggests that it should not be overlooked in knee models.},

Their correct implementation in terms of material models and properties is therefore necessary in the development of finite element models of the knee, which has been performed for decades for the investigation of both its basic biomechanics and the development of replacement implants and repair strategies for degenerative and traumatic pathologies. Indeed, a wide range of element types and material models has been used to represent knee ligaments, ranging from elastic unidimensional elements to complex hyperelastic three-dimensional structures with anatomically realistic shapes. This paper systematically reviews literature studies, which described finite element models of the knee, and summarizes the approaches, which have been used to model the ligaments highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.},

	abstract = {Use of computational models with kinematic boundary conditions to study the knee joint contact behavior for normal and pathologic knee joints depends on an understanding of the impacts of kinematic uncertainty. We studied the sensitivities of tibio-menisco-femoral joint contact behavior to variations in knee kinematics using a finite element model (FEM) with geometry and kinematic boundary conditions derived from sequences of magnetic resonance (MR) images. The MR images were taken before and after axial compression was applied to the knee joint of a healthy subject. A design of experiments approach was used to study the impact of the variation in knee kinematics on the contact outputs. We also explored the feasibility of using supplementary hip images to improve the accuracy of knee kinematics. Variations in knee kinematics (0.25mm in medial–lateral, 0.1mm in anterior–posterior and superior–inferior translations, and 0.1° in flexion–extension and varus–valgus, 0.25° in external–internal rotations) caused large variations in joint contact behavior. When kinematic boundary conditions resulted in close approximations of the model-predicted joint contact force to the applied force, variations in predictions of contact parameters were also reduced. The combination of inferior–superior and medial–lateral translations accounted for over 70\% of variations for all the contact parameters examined. The inclusion of hip images in kinematic calculations improved knee kinematics by matching the femoral head position. Our findings demonstrate the importance of improving the accuracy and precision of knee kinematic measurements, especially when utilized as an input for finite element models.},

A 134-N anterior force at 30° and 90° of flexion and combined valgus (8 N·m) and internal (4 N·m) rotation torques at 15° of flexion were applied simulating tests of anterior and rotatory stability. The ACL was sectioned at the femoral footprint by detaching either the higher band of fibers neighboring the lateral intercondylar ridge in the region of the direct insertion or the posterior, crescent-shaped fibers in the region of the indirect insertion, followed by the remainder of the ACL. The kinematics of the ACL-intact knee was replayed, and the reduction in force due to each sectioned portion of insertion fibers was measured. Isometry was assessed at anteromedial, center, and posterolateral locations within the high and low regions of the femoral footprint.Results:With an anterior tibial force at 30° of flexion, the high fibers carried 83.9\% of the total anterior ACL load compared with 16.1\% in the low fibers (P {\textless} .001). The high fibers also carried more anterior force than the low fibers at 90° of flexion (95.2\% vs 4.8\%; P {\textless} .001). Under combined torques at 15° of flexion, the high fibers carried 84.2\% of the anterior ACL force compared with 15.8\% in the low fibers (P {\textless} .001). Virtual ACL fibers placed at the anteromedial portion of the high region of the femoral footprint were the most isometric, with a maximum length change of 3.9 ± 1.5 mm.Conclusion:ACL fibers located high within the femoral footprint bear more force during stability testing and are more isometric during flexion than low fibers.Clinical Relevance:It may be advantageous to create a ?higher? femoral tunnel during ACL reconstruction at the lateral intercondylar ridge.},

	abstract = {Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains one of the most successful procedures in orthopaedic surgery. Complications certainly exist and are often related to failure of knee ligament balance. This asymmetry subsequently leads to component mal-alignment and loosening often secondary to deviation of the lower extremity mechanical axis. Understanding knee mechanics is essential, and recent technological advances have begun to minimize postoperative problems. A tensioning device that respects the native patellofemoral anatomy as well as the natural ligamentous strains has been developed. The surgical integration of computer- assisted navigation has allowed for enhanced accuracy and subsequently better results. The purpose of the current paper is to discuss the evolution of an improved ligament tensioning device, in the setting of classic mechanical guidance versus computer assistance and its postoperative impact on total knee outcomes in terms of manipulation rates and two-year radiographic alignment data. Based on a single surgeon series, mechanically guided arthroplasties resulted in a 16 per cent manipulation rate. Computer assistance with spacer blocks decreased the manipulation rate to 14 per cent, while using a novel tensioner device further decreased the manipulation rate to 7 per cent, a significant difference of p {\textless} 0.01. Radiographic data illustrate all TKAs with the tensioner to be within 4 degrees of the desired. position.},

	abstract = {This article used probabilistic analysis to evaluate material properties of the in vivo subject-specific tibiofemoral (TF) joint model. Sensitivity analysis, based on a Monte Carlo (MC) method, was performed using a subject-specific finite element (FE) model generated from in vivo computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, subjected to two different loading conditions. Specifically, the effects of inherent uncertainty in ligament stiffness, horn attachment stiffness, and articular surface material properties were assessed using multifactorial global sensitivity analysis. The MRI images were taken before and after axial compression, and when the flexion condition had been maintained at up to 90 degree flexion in the subject-specific knee joint. The loading conditions of the probabilistic subject-specific FE model (axial compression and 90 degree flexion) were similar to the MRI acquisition setup. We were able to detect the influence of material parameters while maintaining the potential effect of parametric interactions. Throughout the in silico property optimization, a subject-specific FE model was used and less sensitive parameters were eliminated in the global sensitivity method. Soft tissue material properties were estimated using an optimization procedure that involved the minimization of the differences between the kinematics predicted by the subject-specific model and those obtained through in vivo subject-specific data. The results of this approach suggest that the articular surface mechanical properties could be found by using in vivo measurements, which clarifies the valuable tool for future subject-specific studies related to TF joint scaffolds, allografts and biologics. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The contralateral healthy knees were scanned using high-resolution 3-T MRI. The tibial insertion sites of the anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL) bundle fibres, and the ACL attachment on the anterior horn of lateral meniscus (AHLM) were segmented from the MR images, and 3D models were reconstructed to evaluate the morphology. The shape of ACL footprint was qualitatively analysed, and the size of AM and PL attachments and AHLM overlapped area was measured digitally.ResultsTibial AM and PL bundles were clearly identified in 42 of 50 knees (84.0\%). Morphology of the whole ACL tibial insertion site was elliptical in 23 knees (54.8\%) and triangular in 19 knees (45.2\%), but not classified as C-shape in any knees. However, the AM bundle attachment was of C-shape in 29 knees (69.0\%) and band-like in 13 knees (31.0\%). Overlap of ACL on AHLM was found in 26 knees (61.9\%), and the size of the overlapped area was 4.8 ± 4.7\% of the whole ACL insertion site.Conclusion3D morphology of the intact ACL tibial insertion site analysed by high-resolution 3-T MRI was elliptical or triangular in healthy young knees. However, the AM bundle insertion site was of C-shape or band-like. A small lateral portion of the ACL was overlapped with the AHLM. As for clinical relevance, these findings should be considered in order to reproduce the native ACL insertion site sufficiently.Level of evidenceIII.},

	abstract = {Twelve fresh frozen anatomic specimen knees were used in this study to measure changes in the tibiofemoral joint gaps after sacrificing the posterior cruciate ligament. Joint gap changes were measured using a motion tracking device in full extension and at 45° and 90° flexion. Tibiofemoral gaps were measured with no external compressive loads and under tension to define the flexion gap, the space available to be filled by components. After initial anterior cruciate ligament removal, meniscectomy, and a 1-cm tibial plateau cut, sacrifice of the posterior cruciate ligament caused significant differences in the flexion gap. At 90° flexion the tibia distracted from the femur 5.26 ± 1.9 mm (range, 3.2-9.1 mm) at rest and 6.4 ± 2.5 mm under tension. No differences in the joint space were calculated in full extension under either loading case. The authors conclude that a major result of posterior cruciate ligament sacrifice is the creation of a larger flexion gap. This result provides insight into relative joint line changes that can occur after posterior cruciate ligament sacrifice. It also suggests the need for greater attention to flexion stability when sacrificing the posterior cruciate ligament and rethinking the role of posterior cruciate ligament release in the management of pure, primary flexion contracture.},

	abstract = {Introduction:It has been realized that for osteoarthritis (OA) knee with varus deformity, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) release resulted in the increase of the flexion gap without significant effect on the extension gap. While the effect of release on gap angle is still obscure. On the other hand, gap distance and varus angle measured under different distraction forces suggest different patterns.Objectives:In the current study, mechanical gap balance in displacement and angular alternation of extension and flexion gaps will be evaluated, with PCL fully retained or resected under different distracting forces in varus knees.Methods:Fifty cases with medial OA undergoing posterior-stabilized (PS) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were included in the study. PCL of all the cases were identified intact before resection. After distal femoral and proximal tibial cuts were initially performed and anterior cruciate ligament was excised, joint gap angle and distance in full extension and at 90° flexion were obtained by means of a tensioning device with 10, 20 and 30 inch-pounds (in-lbf) of distraction force. The gap angle and distance were measured three times at each step. After the excision of PCL, the same measurement was performed.Results:Both the distance and the varus angles of the knee gap enlarged accordingly with the augment of distraction forces at both extension and flexion with or without PCL resection. As to the gap distance, it remained the same after PCL resection at extension; while at flexion, the gap distance significantly (p {\textless} 0.001) enlarged ? 1.2, 1.6 and 1.9 mm ? under 10, 20 and 30 in-lbf, respectively, after PCL resection. As to the varus angles, it significantly (p {\textless} .050) decreased 0.6°, 0.3° and 0.4° at extension; while at flexion, the varus angles decreased 0° (not significant), 0.6° (p {\textless} 0.050) and 1.1° (p {\textless} 0.001) with 10, 20 and 30 in-lbf, respectively, after PCL resection.Conclusion:Our study indicated that the sacrifice of PCL will decrease the varus deformity at both extension and flexion, but with the exception under low distraction force at flexion. A proper distraction tension is of great importance in gap balancing during TKA. Sufficient attention of varus differences should be paid to the gap balance technique when choosing from different techniques, PCL-retained TKA or PCL-sacrificed TKA, as well as and an appropriate distract tension during measurement.},

	abstract = {PurposeThe aim of this review was to identify a reliable sequential medial release protocol for restoration of soft tissue balance in total knee arthroplasty of the varus osteoarthritic knee and to allow for improved intraoperative decision-making.MethodCurrent medial release sequences and applicability based upon pre-operative deformity have been reviewed. Furthermore, risks associated with over release, and the necessity of medial release, are discussed.ResultsThe different medial release sequences are discussed in relation to pre-operative deformity, along with potential complications associated with medial release. It was found that release sequences may include the deep and superficial components of the medial collateral ligament, the posteromedial capsule, the posterior oblique ligament, the pes anserinus (pes A), and tendons of the semimembranosus and medial gastrocnemius muscle. The sequences described were found to vary substantially between studies, and very few studies had systematically quantified the effect of each release on balance.ConclusionWhile medial release is the standard intraoperative mode of balancing, there is a lack of evidence to support current methods. The correct method for defining intraoperatively the sequence, extent and magnitude of releases required remains ill-defined. It could be argued that the classic extensive medial release may be unnecessary and may be associated with iatrogenic injury to the pes A and saphenous nerve, instability and abnormal knee kinematics. Minimal medial release may allow for improved soft tissue balancing leading ultimately to improved functional outcome.Level of evidenceV (expert opinion).},

	abstract = {Abstract Unicomparmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a popular alternative to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and high tibial osteotomy for unicompartmental knee conditions, especially in young patients. However, failure of UKA occurs due to either progressive osteoarthritis (OA) in the other compartment or wear on the polyethylene (PE) insert. This study used finite element (FE) analysis to investigate the effects of PE insert contact pressure and stress in opposite compartments for fixed? and mobile?bearing UKA. Analysis was performed using high kinematics displacement and rotation inputs, which were based on the kinematics of the natural knee. ISO standards were used for axial load and flexion. The mobile?bearing PE insert had lower contact pressure than the fixed?bearing PE insert. With the mobile?bearing UKA, lower stress on the opposite compartment reduces the overall risk of progressive OA in the knee. The fixed?bearing UKA increases the overall risk of progressive OA in the knee due to higher stress on the opposite compartment. However, the PE insert of mobile?bearing showed pronounced backside stress at the inferior surface. ? 2013 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The nature of the complaint after arthroplasty can help determine the etiology of failure. The primary causes of failure of total knee arthroplasty are pain, postoperative stiffness, and instability. Pain associated with weight bearing is most often mechanical and is caused by loosening, component failure, or patellar dysfunction. Continuous pain can be associated with infection or complex regional pain syndrome. Persistent postoperative stiffness may be caused by inadequate rehabilitation or improper balancing of ﬂexion and extension spaces. However, loss of motion after satisfactory mobility has been achieved may be associated with infection, synovitis, tendinitis, or component loosening. Instability after total knee arthroplasty results from improper balancing, inappropriate component size, and component failure. Posterior instability generally occurs during ﬂexion. Medial-lateral instability can result from either improper balancing of components or incompetent collateral ligaments. Radiographs can detect loosening and osteolysis, as well as component wear, fracture, and malposition. Nuclear scans can aid in detecting loosening and infection. If infection is suspected, aspiration is mandatory to attempt to conﬁrm the diagnosis and identify an organism.},

The success of TKA depends on many factors, but malalignment of the prosthetic components is a major cause of postoperative complications. Significant variability is associated with femoral and tibial component rotational alignment, but how this variability translates into functional outcome remains unknown. We used a forward-dynamic computer model of a simulated squatting motion to perform a parametric study of the effects of variations in component rotational alignment in TKA. A cruciate-retaining and posterior-stabilized version of the same TKA implant were compared. We found that femoral rotation had a greater effect on quadriceps forces, collateral ligament forces, and varus/valgus kinematics, while tibial rotation had a greater effect on anteroposterior translations. Our findings support the tendency for orthopedic surgeons to bias the femoral component into external rotation and avoid malrotation of the tibial component. (C) 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society.

When the knee is extended, the posterolateral bundle (PL) is tight and the anteromedial (AM) bundle is moderately lax. As the knee is flexed, the femoral attachment of the ACL becomes a more horizontal orientation; causing the AM bundle to tighten and the PL bundle to relax. There is some degree of variability for the femoral origin of the anterome-dial and posterolateral bundle. The anteromedial bundle is located proximal and anterior in the femoral ACL origin (high and deep in the notch when the knee is flexed at 90°); the posterolateral bundle starts in the distal and posterior aspect of the femoral ACL origin (shallow and low when the knee is flexed at 90°). In the frontal plane the anteromedial bundle origin is in the 10:30 clock position and the postero-lateral bundle origin in the 9:30 clock position. At the tibial insertion the ACL fans out to form the foot region. The anteromedial bundle insertion is in the anterior part of the tibial ACL footprint, the posterolateral bundle in the posterior part. While the anteromedial bundle is the primary restraint against anterior tibial translation, the posterolateral bundle tends to stabilize the knee near full extension, particularly against rotatory loads.},

	abstract = {Little is known about knee-specific factors that influence contact mechanics. Finite Element (FE) models offer a powerful tool to study contact mechanics, but there often exists ambiguity in the exact values of the inputs (e.g., tissue properties), which can result in a range of output values. Our objective was to quantify the reduction in the range of output values (defined herein as “uncertainty”) from FE models of the human knee joint when known pre-defined values are used for clinically measurable inputs. To achieve this goal, we applied a statistically augmented FE approach to three human cadaveric knees for which full geometric and kinematic data were available. Two sets of conditions were simulated: All model inputs, clinically measurable or not, were varied to represent a “normal” patient population (Condition 1); subsets of clinically measurable variable inputs were fixed at specific values (called “patient derived inputs,” or PDIs) while the other variables were varied over “normal” values (Condition 2). We found that by fixing body mass index and the anterior–posterior position of the meniscal-bony insertion points, model output uncertainty was reduced by one- to three-fifths. The magnitude of uncertainty reduction was strongly influenced by the individual knee. It was observed that knees with great anterior–posterior translation during gait had greater reductions in uncertainty when PDIs were used. This study represents the first step in developing FE models of the human knee joint based on inputs that can be derived from patients in a clinical setting. © 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Our aim was to clarify the differing descriptions with a simplified interpretation of the anatomy and its contribution to the stability of the knee.We dissected 20 fresh-frozen cadaver knees and the anatomy was recorded using video and still digital photography. The anatomy was described by dividing the medial collateral ligament (MCL) complex into thirds, from anterior to posterior and into superficial and deep layers. The main passive restraining structures of the posteromedial aspect of the knee were found to be superficial MCL (parallel, longitudinal fibres), the deep MCL and the posteromedial capsule (PMC). In the posterior third, the superficial and deep layers blend. Although there are oblique fibres (capsular condensations) running posterodistally from femur to tibia, no discrete ligament was seen. In extension, the PMC appears to be an important functional unit in restraining tibial internal rotation and valgus.Our aim was to clarify and possibly simplify the anatomy of the posteromedial structures. The information would serve as the basis for future biomechanical studies to investigate the contribution of the posteromedial structures to joint stability.},

Methods: The authors dissected the medial patellofemoral ligament in 11 cadaveric knees and recorded its anatomic relationships. They evaluated the isometry of the medial patellofemoral ligament by obtaining measurements between various anatomic pairings at certain fixed angles of knee flexion.
Results: During knee flexion from 0° to 90°, the portion of the medial patellofemoral ligament from the inferior patellar attachment to the superior femoral attachment was nearly isometric, demonstrating an average change in length of only 1.1 mm. Statistical analysis showed the superior femoral attachment to be most significant in determining isometric behavior.
Conclusions: The most isometric portion of the medial patellofemoral ligament is the inferior portion of its patellar attachment extending to the superior portion of its femoral attachment, with the superior femoral attachment having the most notable influences on isometry.},

	abstract = {Most descriptions of the extensor mechanism of the knee do not take into account its complexity and variability. The quadriceps femoris insertion into the patella is said to be through a common tendon with a three-layered arrangement: rectus femoris (RF) most superficially, vastus medialis (VM) and lateralis (VL) in the intermediate layer, and vastus intermedius (VI) most deeply. We dissected 20 limbs from 17 cadavers to provide a more detailed description of the anterior components of the knee: the tendon, the patellar retinacula, and the patellofemoral ligaments. Only three of the 20 specimens exhibited the typically described quadriceps pattern. The remainder had bilaminar and even more complex trilaminar and tetralaminar fiber arrangements. We found an oblique head of the vastus lateralis (VLO), separated from the longitudinal head by a layer of fat or fascia, in 60\% of the specimens. However, we found no distinct oblique head of the vastus medialis (VMO) in any specimen. The medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) was more common than the lateral (LPFL), supporting its suggested role as the principal passive medial stabilizer of the patella. Because the quadriceps muscle group plays a direct role in patellofemoral joint function, investigation into the clinical applications of its highly variable anatomy may be worthwhile with respect to joint dysfunction and failures of TKAs.},

	abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this study was to review the anatomy of the quadriceps tendon and provide guidelines for harvesting the quadriceps tendon for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.
Methods
Eleven cadaveric knees were dissected, and the quadriceps tendon was analyzed. Multiple measurements of length, depth, and width were taken in a standardized manner for each cadaver and recorded.
Results
The quadriceps tendon superficial morphology showed 2 distinct peaks, with the maximum length correlating with the lateral peak. The mean tendon peak length was 88.3 ± 8.4 mm (range, 78.3 to 99.7 mm). The mean width of the quadriceps tendon at its insertion onto the patella was 43.3 ± 5.8 mm (range, 34.3 to 54.1 mm). The quadriceps tendon was noted to be asymmetric, with the maximum tendon length located at 61.6\% ± 4.1\% of the width from the medial border of the quadriceps tendon insertion. This point was also the maximum tendon depth at insertion.
Conclusions
Quadriceps free tendon graft harvesting should begin by locating the apex (maximum length) of the quadriceps tendon (61\% of the distance from the patella's medial edge). The surgeon should then harvest a 10-mm-wide graft centered about 2 mm medial to this point, using the depth of a No. 10 scalpel blade (7 mm) as a guide to thickness to harvest an optimal quadriceps free tendon graft for ACL reconstruction.
Clinical Relevance
This anatomic study identifies the site of harvest of a quadriceps free tendon autograft (without a patellar bone block) to maximize the length and bulk of the graft for its use in ACL reconstruction.},

	abstract = {Background:While the biomechanical importance of the meniscal roots has been demonstrated, the anatomy of the anterior meniscal roots remains largely unknown. Defining the quantitative anatomy of the anterior meniscal root attachments is essential for developing improved diagnostic and surgical techniques.Hypothesis:The anterior medial (AM) and anterior lateral (AL) meniscal roots could be quantitatively defined relative to open and arthroscopic surgical landmarks.Study Design:Descriptive laboratory study.Methods:Twelve nonpaired human cadaveric knees were used (average age, 51.3 years). A coordinate measuring device quantified the anatomic relationships of the AM and AL root attachments to open and arthroscopic surgical landmarks. The tibial attachments of both anterior roots were defined and quantified by categorizing the fibers of the root as either central, dense attachments or peripheral, supplemental attachments.Results:The center of the tibial tuberosity and the medial tibial eminence apex were 27.0 mm lateral and distal and 27.5 mm posterior to the center of the AM root, respectively. The center of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the lateral tibial eminence apex were 5.0 mm posteromedial and 14.4 mm posterolateral to the center of the AL root, respectively. The AM root attachment had a mean area of 110.4 mm2 (95\% CI, 92.2-128.5) with a central attachment of 56.3 mm2 (95\% CI, 46.9-65.8). The AL root attachment had a mean area of 140.7 mm2 (95\% CI, 121.6-159.8) and inserted deeply beneath the ACL in all specimens. The overlap of the ACL on the AL root averaged 88.9 mm2 (95\% CI, 63.3-114.6), comprising 63.2\% of the AL root attachment.Conclusion:The anterior meniscal roots were identified in relation to pertinent open and arthroscopic landmarks. The extended overlap between the AL root and ACL attachment revealed a more intimate tibial attachment relationship than previously recognized.Clinical Relevance:Quantitative descriptions of the anterior meniscal roots elucidate the relationship between the root attachments and pertinent surgical landmarks. In addition, the supplemental attachments of both menisci may contribute to native meniscal function, and further investigation is recommended.},

While the anatomy of the primary posterolateral corner structures has been qualitatively and quantitatively described, a quantitative analysis regarding the insertions of the biceps femoris on the fibula and proximal tibia is lacking.Purpose:To quantitatively assess the insertions of the biceps femoris, fibular collateral ligament (FCL), and anterolateral ligament (ALL) on the fibula and proximal tibia as well as establish relationships among these structures and to pertinent surgical anatomy.Study Design:Descriptive laboratory study.Methods:Dissections were performed on 12 nonpaired, fresh-frozen cadaveric specimens identifying the biceps femoris, FCL, and ALL, and their insertions on the proximal tibia and fibula. The footprint areas, orientations, and distances from relevant osseous landmarks were measured using a 3-dimensional coordinate measurement device.Results:Dissection produced 6 easily identifiable and reproducible anatomic footprints. Tibial footprints included the insertion of the ALL and an insertion of the biceps femoris (TBF). Fibular footprints included the insertion of the FCL, a distal insertion of the biceps femoris (DBF), a medial footprint of the biceps femoris (MBF), and a proximal footprint of the biceps femoris (PBF). The mean area of these footprints (95\% CI) was as follows: ALL, 53.0 mm2 (38.4-67.6); TBF, 93.9 mm2 (72.0-115.8); FCL, 86.8 mm2 (72.3-101.2); DBF, 119 mm2 (91.1-146.9); MBF, 46.8 mm2 (29.0-64.5); and PBF, 215 mm2 (192.4-237.5). The mean distance (95\% CI) from the Gerdy tubercle to the center of the ALL footprint was 24.3 mm (21.6-27.0) and to the center of the TBF was 22.5 mm (21.0-24.0). The center of the DBF was 8.68 mm (7.0-10.3) from the anterior border of the fibula, the center of the FCL was 14.6 mm (12.5-16.7) from the anterior border of the fibula and 20.7 mm (19.0-22.4) from the tip of the fibular styloid, and the center of the PBF was 8.96 mm (8.2-9.7) from the tip of the fibular styloid.Conclusion:A tibial footprint, distal fibular footprint, medial fibular footprint, and proximal fibular footprint were all consistent components of the insertion of the biceps femoris. Consistent relationships existed between the biceps femoris and insertions of the ALL and FCL.Clinical Relevance:The size of these footprints and distances from pertinent surgical landmarks will guide repairs of biceps femoris avulsion injuries.},

	abstract = {Residual stress is the stress present in the unloaded equilibrium configuration of a body. Because residual stresses can significantly affect the mechanical behavior of a component, the measurement of these stresses and the prediction of their effect on mechanical behavior are important objectives in many engineering problems. Common methods for the measurement of residual stresses include various destructive experiments in which the body is cut to relieve the residual stress. The resulting strain is measured and used to approximate the original residual stress in the intact body. In order to predict the mechanical behavior of a residually stressed body, a constitutive model is required that includes the influence of the residual stress.In this paper we present a method by which the data obtained from standard destructive experiments can be used to derive constitutive equations that describe the mechanical behavior of elastic residually stressed bodies. The derivation is based on the idea that for each infinitesimal neighborhood in a residually stressed body, there exists a corresponding stress free configuration. We refer to this stress free configuration as the ‘virtual’ configuration of the infinitesimal neighborhood. The derivation requires that the constitutive equation for the stress free material be known and invertible; it is used to relate the residual stress to the deformation of the virtual configuration into the residually stressed configuration. Although the concept of the virtual configuration is central to the derivation, the geometry of this configuration need not be determined explicitly, and it need not be achievable experimentally, in order to construct the constitutive equation for the residually stressed body.The general mathematical forms of constitutive equations valid for residually stressed elastic materials have been derived previously for a number of cases. These general forms contain numerous unknown material-response functions or material constants that must be determined experimentally. In contrast, the method presented here results in a constitutive equation that is an explicit function of residual stress and includes only the material parameters required to describe the stress free material.After presenting the method for the derivation of constitutive equations, we explore the relationship between destructive experiments and the theory used in the derivation. Specifically, we discuss the use of the theory to improve the design of destructive experiments, and the use of destructive experiments to obtain the data required to construct the constitutive equation for a particular material.},

	abstract = {It is often important to include prestress in computational models of biological tissues. The prestress can represent residual stresses (stresses that exist after the tissue is excised from the body) or in situ stresses (stresses that exist in vivo, in the absence of loading). A prestressed reference configuration may also be needed when modeling the reference geometry of biological tissues in vivo. This research developed a general framework for representing prestress in finite element models of biological materials. It is assumed that the material is elastic, allowing the prestress to be represented via a prestrain. For prestrain fields that are not compatible with the reference geometry, the computational framework provides an iterative algorithm for updating the prestrain until equilibrium is satisfied. The iterative framework allows for enforcement of two different constraints: elimination of distortion in order to address the incompatibility issue, and enforcing a specified in situ fiber strain field while allowing for distortion. The framework was implemented as a plugin in FEBio (www.febio.org), making it easy to maintain the software and to extend the framework if needed. Several examples illustrate the application and effectiveness of the approach, including the application of in situ strains to ligaments in the Open Knee model (simtk.org/home/openknee). A novel method for recovering the stress-free configuration from the prestrain deformation gradient is also presented. This general purpose theoretical and computational framework for applying prestrain will allow analysts to overcome the challenges in modeling this important aspect of biological tissue mechanics.},

	abstract = {Background
Musculoskeletal soft tissues, such as articular cartilage, ligaments, knee meniscus and intervertebral disk, have a complex structure, which provides elasticity and capability to support and distribute the body loads. Soft tissues describe an inhomogeneous and multiphasic structure, and exhibit a nonlinear, time-dependent behavior. Their mechanical response is governed by a substance composed of protein fiber-rich and proteoglycan-rich extracellular matrix and interstitial fluid. Protein fibers (e.g. collagen) give the tissue direction dependent stiffness and strength. To investigate these complex biological systems, the use of mathematical tools is well established, alone or in combination with experimental in vitro and in vivo tests. However, the development of these models poses many challenges due to the complex structure and mechanical response of soft tissues.
Methods
Non-systematic literature review.
Findings
This paper provides a summary of different modeling strategies with associated material properties, contact interactions between articulating tissues, validation and sensitivity of soft tissues with special focus on knee joint soft tissues and intervertebral disk. Furthermore, it reviews and discusses some salient clinical findings of reported finite element simulations.
Interpretation
Model studies extensively contributed to the understanding of functional biomechanics of soft tissues. Models can be effectively used to elucidate clinically relevant questions. However, users should be aware of the complexity of such tissues and of the capabilities and limitations of these approaches to adequately simulate a specific in vivo or in vitro phenomenon.},

	abstract = {This brief communication describes the use of an iterative algorithm to tackle the inverse elasto-static problem which has two important applications: identifying the required initial body shape which deforms into a desired one when subject to a given set of loads; identifying the unloaded shape of a structure from a given deformed shape and a prescribed set of loads. The iterative algorithm stems from the rather intuitive observation that a better estimate of the required initial shape can be obtained by adding a correction to the previous shape estimate equal to the computed mismatch in the deformed shapes. A detailed convergence analysis explains the reason behind the success of the proposed algorithm. Compared to other techniques described in the literature to solve such inverse problems, this iterative scheme offers the advantage of being easy to implement and readily compatible with the use of commercial solver packages. Two benchmark problems are treated to illustrate the success of the algorithm: that of a punctured membrane and that of a cantilever beam in cross flow. The latter illustrates that the concepts described here readily applies to steady fluid–structure interaction problems leading to an interesting range of new applications.},

One of the many challenges of this approach, however, is identification of a stress-free reference configuration based on in vivo images of loaded and often prestrained or residually stressed soft tissues and organs. Fortunately, iterative methods have been proposed to solve this inverse problem, among them Sellier’s method. This method is particularly appealing because it is easy to implement, convergences reasonably fast, and can be coupled to nearly any finite element package. By means of several practical examples, however, we demonstrate that in its original formulation Sellier’s method is not optimally fast and may not converge for problems with large deformations. Fortunately, we can also show that a simple, inexpensive augmentation of Sellier’s method based on Aitken’s delta-squared process can not only ensure convergence but also significantly accelerate the method.},

In this letter, following recent developments in inverse deformation problems, the governing equations for static hyperelasticity problems are formulated in the current configuration after deformation. An inverse mapping from the deformed geometry to the original one is solved as the unknown field. Such an approach, herein referred to as the inverse Lagrangian formulation, is exemplified with several applications in addition to the inverse problem of known deformed geometry by design and determination of the original geometry. Applications are found in steady-state fluid–structure interaction problems, such as the design of microfluidic devices. More importantly, the method is also found to be useful in analyzing mechanical instability and bifurcation problems, as the inverse mapping from a buckled state to the original remains unique.},

The model is particularly focused on the design of parts with a markedly anisotropic behavior, like laminated turbine blades. Although the formulation expresses equilibrium on the distorted configuration, it uses a standard constitutive equations library that is expressed as usual for measures attached to the undistorted configuration. In this way, the modifications to a standard finite elements code are limited to the routines for the computation of the finite element internal forces and tangent matrix. Two examples are given, the first one for validation purposes, while the second is an application which has industrial interest for the design of turbine blades.

The contribution of supplemental fibers to the biomechanical properties of native meniscal roots is unknown.Hypothesis/Purpose:The purpose was to quantify the ultimate failure strengths, stiffness, and attachment areas of the native posterior medial (PM), posterior lateral (PL), anterior medial (AM), and anterior lateral (AL) meniscal roots compared with the most prominent, dense meniscal root attachment after sectioning of supplemental fibers. It was hypothesized that the ultimate failure strength, stiffness, and attachment area of each native root would be significantly higher than those of the respective sectioned root.Study Design:Controlled laboratory study.Methods:Twelve matched pairs of male human cadaveric knees were used. The 4 native meniscal roots were left intact in the native group, whereas the roots in the contralateral knee (sectioned group) were dissected free of all supplemental fibers. A coordinate measuring device quantified the amount of tissue resected in the sectioned group compared with the native group. A dynamic tensile testing machine pulled each root in line with its circumferential fibers. All root attachments were preconditioned from 10 to 50 N at a rate of 0.1 Hz for 10 cycles and subsequently pulled to failure at a rate of 0.5 mm/s.Results:Supplemental fibers composed a significant percentage of the native PM, PL, and AM meniscal root attachment areas. Mean ultimate failure strengths (in newtons) of the native PM, PL, and AM roots were significantly higher than those of the sectioned state, while the ultimate failure strength of the native AL root was indistinguishable from that of the sectioned state.Conclusion:Three of the 4 meniscal root attachments (PM, PL, AM) contained supplemental fibers that accounted for a significant percentage of the native root attachment areas, and these fibers significantly contributed to the failure strengths of the native roots.Clinical Relevance:These supplemental fibers are not routinely reattached during root repair surgery, suggesting that current techniques fail to reattach the biomechanically relevant attachments of native meniscal roots.},

Modeling and simulation approaches such as finite element analysis also provide the possibility to understand the influence of surgical procedures and implants on joint stresses and tissue deformations. A large number of knee joint models are described in the biomechanics literature. However, freely accessible, customizable, and easy-to-use models are scarce. Availability of such models can accelerate clinical translation of simulations, where labor intensive reproduction of model development steps can be avoided. The interested parties can immediately utilize readily available models for scientific discovery and for clinical care. Motivated by this gap, this study aims to describe an open source and freely available finite element representation of the tibiofemoral joint, namely Open Knee, which includes detailed anatomical representation of the joint's major tissue structures, their nonlinear mechanical properties and interactions. Three use cases illustrate customization potential of the model, its predictive capacity, and its scientific and clinical utility: prediction of joint movements during passive flexion, examining the role of meniscectomy on contact mechanics and joint movements, and understanding anterior cruciate ligament mechanics. A summary of scientific and clinically directed studies conducted by other investigators are also provided. The utilization of this open source model by groups other than its developers emphasizes the premise of model sharing as an accelerator of simulation-based medicine. Finally, the imminent need to develop next generation knee models are noted. These are anticipated to incorporate individualized anatomy and tissue properties supported by specimen-specific joint mechanics data for evaluation, all acquired in vitro from varying age groups and pathological states.},

	abstract = {Acustom knee loading apparatus (KLA), when used in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging, enables in vivo measurement of the gross anterior laxity of the knee joint. A numerical model was applied to the KLA to understand the contribution of the individual joint structures and to estimate the stiffness of the anterior-cruciate ligament (ACL). The model was evaluated with a cadaveric study using an in situ knee loading apparatus and an ElectroForce test system. A constrained optimization solution technique was able to predict the restraining forces within the soft-tissue structures and joint contact. The numerical model presented here allowed in vivo prediction of thematerial stiffness parameters of the ACL in response to applied anterior loading. Promising results were obtained for in vivo load sharing within the structures. The numerical model overestimated the ACL forces by 27.61-92.71\%. This study presents a novel approach to estimate ligament stiffness and provides the basis to develop a robust and accurate measure of in vivo knee joint laxity.},

	abstract = {PurposeAccurate soft tissue balance must be achieved to improve functional outcome after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Sensor-integrated tibial trials have been introduced that allow real-time measurement of tibiofemoral kinematics during TKA. This study examined the interplay between tibiofemoral force and laxity, under defined intraoperative conditions, so as to quantify the kinematic behaviour of the CR femoral single-radius knee.MethodsTKA was undertaken in eight loaded cadaveric specimens. Computer navigation in combination with sensor data defined laxity and tibiofemoral contact force, respectively, during manual laxity testing. Fixed-effect linear modelling allowed quantification of the effect for flexion angle, direction of movement and TKA implantation upon the knee.ResultsAn inverse relationship between laxity and contact force was demonstrated. With flexion, laxity increased as contact force decreased under manual stress. Change in laxity was significant beyond 30° for coronal plane laxity and beyond 60° for rotatory laxity (p {\textless} 0.01). Rotational stress in mid-flexion demonstrated the greatest mismatch in inter-compartmental forces. Contact point position over the tibial sensor demonstrated paradoxical roll-forward with knee flexion.ConclusionTraditional balancing techniques may not reliably equate to uniform laxity or contact forces across the tibiofemoral joint through a range of flexion and argue for the role of per-operative sensor use to aid final balancing of the knee.},

Their correct implementation in terms of material models and properties is therefore necessary in the development of finite element models of the knee, which has been performed for decades for the investigation of both its basic biomechanics and the development of replacement implants and repair strategies for degenerative and traumatic pathologies. Indeed, a wide range of element types and material models has been used to represent knee ligaments, ranging from elastic unidimensional elements to complex hyperelastic three-dimensional structures with anatomically realistic shapes. This paper systematically reviews literature studies, which described finite element models of the knee, and summarizes the approaches, which have been used to model the ligaments highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.},

Each cruciate ligament was modelled by means of 25 elastic springs, paying attention to the anatomical twisting of the fibres. The sensitivity of the model to the cross-sectional area was performed during the anterior/posterior tibial translations, the sensitivity to all the cruciate ligaments parameters was performed during the internal/external rotations. The model reproduced very well the mechanical behaviour reported in literature during anterior/posterior translations, in particular considering 30\% of the mean insertional area. During the internal/external tibial rotations, similar behaviour of the axial torques was obtained in the three sensitivity analyses. The overlapping of the ligaments was assessed at about 25° of internal axial rotation. The presented model featured a good level of accuracy in combination with a low computational weight, and it could provide an in vivo estimation of the role of the cruciate ligaments during the execution of daily living activities.},

It is unclear how different ACL reconstruction techniques affect knee joint motion and mechanics. As the in vivo measurement of knee joint loading is not possible, we used finite element analysis to assess the outcome of ACL reconstruction techniques. Effects of different ACL reconstruction techniques on knee joint mechanics were studied using six models during gait; with 1) healthy ACL, 2) ACL rupture, 3) single bundle ACL reconstruction, 4) double bundle ACL reconstruction, 5) weakened (softer) single bundle reconstruction and 6) single bundle reconstruction with less pre-strain. Early in the gait, the ACL rupture caused substantially increased tibial translation in the anterior direction as well as a smaller but increased lateral translation and internal tibial rotation. ACL rupture substantially reduced average stresses and strains, while local peak stresses and strains could be either increased or decreased. Single bundle and double bundle reconstructions restored joint motion close to normal levels. However, cartilage strains and stresses were elevated during the entire gait cycle. Models with modulated graft stiffness and pre-strain restored the joint motion and cartilage stresses and strains close to the normal, healthy levels. Results suggest that rather than the choice of reconstruction technique, stiffness and pre-strain of the ACL reconstruction affect the motion and mechanics of the operated knee. We suggest that an optimal choice of graft properties might help restore normal knee joint function and cartilage responses, thus, minimizing the risk of osteoarthritis.},

Our objective was to measure the kinematics of the medial collateral ligament during the stance phase of gait on a treadmill using a combined dual fluoroscopic imaging system (DFIS) and MRI technique.MethodsThree-dimensional models of the knee were constructed using magnetic resonance images of 7 healthy human knees. The contours of insertion areas of the superficial MCL (sMCL) and deep MCL (dMCL) on the femur and tibia were constructed using the coronal plane MR images of each knee. Both the sMCL and the dMCL were separated into 3 portions: the anterior, mid, and posterior bundles. The relative elongation of the bundles was calculated using the bundle length at heel strike (or 0\% of the stance phase) as a reference.ResultsThe lengths of the anterior bundles were positively correlated with the knee flexion angle. The mid-bundles of the sMCL and dMCL were found to function similarly in trend with the anterior bundles during the stance phase of the gait and their lengths had weak correlations with the knee flexion angles. The elongations of the posterior bundles of sMCL and dMCL were peaked at mid-stance and terminal extension/pre-swing stance phase. The lengths of the posterior bundles were negatively correlated with the knee flexion during the stance phase.ConclusionThe data of this study demonstrated that the anterior and posterior bundles of the sMCL and dMCL have a reciprocal function during the stance phase of gait. This data provide insight into the function of the MCL and a normal reference for the study of physiology and pathology of the MCL. The data may be useful in designing reconstruction techniques to better reproduce the native biomechanical behavior of the MCL.Level of evidenceIV.},

Three cutting sequences allowed the roles of the 3 structures to be seen in isolation and in combination. Some force contributions were also calculated.ResultsThe posteromedial capsule controlled valgus, internal rotation, and posterior drawer in extension, resisting 42\% of a 150-N drawer force when the tibia was in internal rotation. The superficial collateral ligament controlled valgus at all angles and was dominant from 30° to 90° of flexion, plus internal rotation in flexion. The deep collateral ligament controlled tibial anterior drawer of the flexed and externally rotated knee and was a secondary restraint to valgus.ConclusionDistinct roles in controlling tibiofemoral laxity have been found for these structures that vary according to knee flexion and tibial rotation.Clinical RelevanceThe restraining functions demonstrated provide new information about knee stabilization, which may allow better evaluation of structural damage at the medial aspect of the knee.},

Although the medial collateral ligament is known to provide a primary restraint to valgus and external rotations, details regarding its precise mechanical function are unknown. In this study, strain in the medial collateral ligament of eight knees from male cadavers was measured during valgus loading. A material testing machine was used to apply 10 cycles of varus and valgus rotation to limits of +/- 10.0 N-m at flexion angles of 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees. A three-dimensional motion analysis system measured local tissue strain on the medial collateral ligament surface within 12 regions encompassing nearly the entire medial collateral ligament surface. Results indicated that strain is significantly different in different regions over the surface of the medial collateral ligament and that this distribution of strain changes with flexion angle and with the application of a valgus torque. Strain in the posterior and central portions of the medial collateral ligament generally decreased with increasing flexion angle, whereas strain in the anterior fibers remained relatively constant with changes in flexion angle. The highest strains in the medial collateral ligament were found at full extension on the posterior side of the medial collateral ligament near the femoral insertion. These data support clinical findings that suggest the femoral insertion is the most common location for medial collateral ligament injuries.},

The interaction between the AM and PL bundles, as well as the contact and friction caused by the ACL wrapping around the bone during knee motion, were included in the model. The AM and PL bundles of the ACL were simulated as incompressible homogeneous and isotropic hyperelastic materials. The multiple-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) knee kinematics of a cadaveric knee were first obtained using a robotic/universal force–moment sensor testing system. These data were used as the boundary conditions for the FEM of the ACL to calculate the forces in the ACL. The calculated forces were compared to the in situ force in the ACL, determined experimentally, to validate the model. The validated FEM was then used to calculate the force and stress distribution within the ACL under an anterior tibial load at full extension. The AM and PL bundles shared the force, and the stress distribution was non-uniform within both bundles with the highest stress localized near the femoral insertion site. The contact and friction caused by the ACL wrapping around the bone during knee motion played the role of transferring the force from the ACL to the bone, and had a direct effect on the force and stress distribution of the ACL. This validated model will enable the analysis of force and stress distribution in the ACL in response to more complex loading conditions and has the potential to help design improved surgical procedures following ACL injuries.},

A factorial analysis revealed a significant interaction between the site experiencing the greatest strain and flexion angle. The posterior superior site experienced significantly greater strain at 0° flexion whereas strain was significantly greater at the anterior superior site at 30° flexion. Of the single moments, external axial was more damaging than valgus in that the strain developed at equivalent load was significantly greater. None of the moment-moment combinations was identified as being significantly more damaging. A similar result held for the force-moment combinations.},

	abstract = {In simulation of biomechanical structures the patient-specific geometry of the object of interest is very often reconstructed from in vivo medical imaging such as CT scans. Such geometries therefore represent a deformed configuration stressed by typical in vivo conditions. Commonly, such structures are considered stress free in simulation. In this contribution we present and compare two methods to introduce a physically meaningful stress/strain state to the obtained geometry for simulations in the finite strain regime and demonstrate the necessity of such prestressing techniques. One method is based on an inverse design analysis to calculate a stress-free reference configuration. The other method developed here is based on a modified updated Lagrangian formulation. The formulation of both methods is provided in detail and implementation issues are discussed. Applicability and accurateness of both approaches are compared and evaluated utilizing an analytical aorta model and fully three-dimensional patient-specific abdominal aortic aneurysm structures in the finite strain regime.

	abstract = {The objectives of this study were (1) to develop subject-specific experimental and finite element (FE) techniques to study the three-dimensional stress–strain behavior of ligaments, with application to the human medial collateral ligament (MCL), and (2) to determine the importance of subject-specific material properties and initial (in situ) strain distribution for prediction of the strain distribution in the MCL under valgus loading. Eight male knees were subjected to varus–valgus loading at flexion angles of 0°, 30°, and 60°. Three-dimensional joint kinematics and MCL strains were recorded during kinematic testing. Following testing, the MCL of each knee was removed to allow measurement of the in situ strain distribution and to perform material testing. A FE model of the femur–MCL–tibia complex was constructed for each knee to simulate valgus loading at each flexion angle, using subject-specific bone and ligament geometry, material properties, and joint kinematics. A transversely isotropic hyperelastic material model was used to represent the MCL. The MCL in situ strain distribution at full extension was used to apply in situ strain to each MCL FE model. FE predicted MCL strains during valgus loading were compared to experimental measurements using regression analysis. The subject-specific FE predictions of strain correlated reasonably well with experimentally measured MCL strains (R2=0.83, 0.72, and 0.66 at 0°, 30°, and 60°, respectively). Despite large inter-subject variation in MCL material properties, MCL strain distributions predicted by individual FE models that used average MCL material properties were strongly correlated with subject-specific FE strain predictions (R2=0.99 at all flexion angles). However, predictions by FE models that used average in situ strain distributions yielded relatively poor correlations with subject-specific FE predictions (R2=0.44, 0.35, and 0.33 at flexion angles of 0°, 30°, and 60°, respectively). The strain distribution within the MCL was nonuniform and changed with flexion angle. The highest MCL strains occurred at full extension in the posterior region of the MCL proximal to the joint line during valgus loading, suggesting this region may be most vulnerable to injury under these loading conditions. This work demonstrates that subject-specific FE models can predict the complex, nonuniform strain fields that occur in ligaments due to external loading of the joint.},

	abstract = {The general objectives of the work reported in this article were to describe and validate a method for directly measuring strain in the posterolateral bundle (PLB) of the anterior curciate ligament (ACL). The method is a procedure for gaining surgical access to the posterior fibers of the PLB through a portal incised in the joint capsule and then suturing a liquid metal strain gage (LMSG) on to these fibres. Because the incision possibly alters the load-displacement mechanics of the joint, validation included performing experiments to test the hypothesis that the incision did not significantly affect load-displacement relations. To illustrate the utility of the method, strains in both the anteromedial bundle (AMB) and PLB were measured and compared over the full range of flexion. Validation experiments revealed that the capsular incision as well as other incisions had no measurable effect on the load-displacement mechanics of the joint. Also, the PLB strain was significantly different from the AMB strain during passive flexion with a reciprocating function in load sharing evident between the two bundles.},
